The Nationals MP Andrew Broad told Guardian Australia\u2019s Politics Live podcast there needed to be consideration about whether 15% of gas supply should be reserved for Australian manufacturing rather than exported. Noting that his view differed from the position of federal Liberal party colleagues on the question, Broad said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a real discussion that has to be had about a reserve policy.\u201d He said there was already a reserve policy in Western Australia and that policy had worked.

The two MPs, who entered parliament together in the 2013 election and have parliamentary offices close to one another, have taken it upon themselves to try to carve out some territory of mutual agreement in an effort to get past the pitched partisan battle that has raged about power prices and energy security. Conroy, who is the shadow assistant minister for climate change and energy, said there was \u201creal merit\u201d in looking at a domestic reserve policy for gas but he said the major issue was price. \u201cAt the moment, Australian manufacturers are not paying export parity, they are paying above export parity,\u201d Conroy said. He said Australian manufacturers were paying more for gas than energy companies in Japan and South Korea \u201cand that means there\u2019s something wrong with the market\u201d. \u201cThis issue is not just reservation, it\u2019s pricing.\u201d Gas prices have soared, rising from $3 to $4 a gigajoule on average to about $6 or $7 \u2013 with periodic price spikes as high as $20. The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has thus far resisted calls for a domestic gas reserve. Frydenberg noted in early February the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Productivity Commission had argued a national gas reservation policy was unwise. He said the government was interested in \u201cinnovative ways\u201d of getting more supply into the domestic market to overcome the roadblocks created by state moratoria on coal seam gas exploration.

Statewide surveys suggest Labor may struggle to win enough seats to form government but local polling suggests Labor is gaining enough of a swing to win the 10 seats it needs.</p> <p>On the <a href=\"http://www.boundaries.wa.gov.au/electoral-boundaries/11-march-2017-state-general-election-boundaries\">new electoral boundaries</a>, Labor holds 20 seats, with the Liberal-National Coalition holding the remaining 39. A net gain of 10 seats for Labor would give it a majority.</p> <p>The pendulum suggests Labor needs a uniform swing of at least 9.2% to win the 10 seats it needs to form government. Labor polled 42.7% of the two-party-preferred vote in 2013, so this implies that Labor would need to win substantially more than half of the two-party-preferred vote to win a majority.</p> <p>All of this, however, assumes that swings are uniform, which they are often not. If Labor gains larger swings in a handful of key seats, it could well form government with a statewide swing of less than 9.2%.</p> <p>Labor reached 54% of the vote after preferences in January\u2019s Newspoll. A February ReachTel poll put Labor and the Coalition tied on 50% and <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/wa-news/wa-election-one-nation-vote-on-the-skids-poll-20170302-gupe6n.html\">Friday\u2019s Reachtel poll</a> had Labor back to 52%.

ReachTel this week polled voters in 15 marginal seats and found a swing of roughly 12% to Labor and away from the Coalition. We have also seen ReachTel individual seat polls of six key marginal seats commissioned by the advocacy group the Parenthood. All six polls put Labor on track to gain the seat and the average swing to Labor was about 13%.</p> <p>If these marginal seat polls are accurate, it suggests Labor\u2019s statewide support is higher than we have seen in statewide polls, or that the party is gaining a much smaller swing in safer seats. Either way, this would put Labor in a position to win power on 11 March.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/14/one-nation-could-gain-more-than-the-liberals-from-western-australia-seats-deal\">One Nation could gain more than the Liberals from Western Australia seats deal | Ben Raue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s harder to predict the outcome owing to the limited polling data \u2013 with very little statewide polling to compare. It\u2019s also hard to predict the outcome owing to the role of One Nation.</p> <p>One Nation has had some strong polling but it\u2019s not clear how much of that vote is in key marginal seats. The party polled just under 8.5% in the most recent statewide ReachTel poll, compared with up to 13% in previous polls. Evidence from the 2016 federal election suggests One Nation\u2019s support is concentrated in regional seats, most of which are held by the Nationals. </p> <p>We still don\u2019t have a good sense of whether One Nation will be able to deliver preferences to the Liberal party in those key marginal seats, and how big its vote will be in those seats. We also don\u2019t know if One Nation\u2019s vote will be high enough in regional areas to win seats previously considered safe for the Liberal or National parties, and thus threatening the Coalition\u2019s ability to win a majority, whether or not Labor wins enough seats for its own majority.</p>",

On the new electoral boundaries, Labor holds 20 seats, with the Liberal-National Coalition holding the remaining 39. A net gain of 10 seats for Labor would give it a majority. The pendulum suggests Labor needs a uniform swing of at least 9.2% to win the 10 seats it needs to form government. Labor polled 42.7% of the two-party-preferred vote in 2013, so this implies that Labor would need to win substantially more than half of the two-party-preferred vote to win a majority. All of this, however, assumes that swings are uniform, which they are often not. If Labor gains larger swings in a handful of key seats, it could well form government with a statewide swing of less than 9.2%. Labor reached 54% of the vote after preferences in January\u2019s Newspoll. A February ReachTel poll put Labor and the Coalition tied on 50% and Friday\u2019s Reachtel poll had Labor back to 52%. This would suggest a swing of 9.3%. We don\u2019t have a lot of polling data to work with, but we have at least two polls which suggest a larger swing to Labor in the key marginal seats. ReachTel this week polled voters in 15 marginal seats and found a swing of roughly 12% to Labor and away from the Coalition. We have also seen ReachTel individual seat polls of six key marginal seats commissioned by the advocacy group the Parenthood. All six polls put Labor on track to gain the seat and the average swing to Labor was about 13%. If these marginal seat polls are accurate, it suggests Labor\u2019s statewide support is higher than we have seen in statewide polls, or that the party is gaining a much smaller swing in safer seats. Either way, this would put Labor in a position to win power on 11 March. It\u2019s harder to predict the outcome owing to the limited polling data \u2013 with very little statewide polling to compare. It\u2019s also hard to predict the outcome owing to the role of One Nation. One Nation has had some strong polling but it\u2019s not clear how much of that vote is in key marginal seats. The party polled just under 8.5% in the most recent statewide ReachTel poll, compared with up to 13% in previous polls. Evidence from the 2016 federal election suggests One Nation\u2019s support is concentrated in regional seats, most of which are held by the Nationals. We still don\u2019t have a good sense of whether One Nation will be able to deliver preferences to the Liberal party in those key marginal seats, and how big its vote will be in those seats. We also don\u2019t know if One Nation\u2019s vote will be high enough in regional areas to win seats previously considered safe for the Liberal or National parties, and thus threatening the Coalition\u2019s ability to win a majority, whether or not Labor wins enough seats for its own majority.",

Meet: the goal keepers.<br /></p> <p>Goal keeper is one of netball\u2019s true \u201ckey\u201d positons. Like a centre-half forward in Australian rules football, theirs is a make-or-break role. They have an almost-unparalleled influence on a team\u2019s chances of success, so one of a side\u2019s most tenacious and \u201cgame smart\u201d players usually wears the \u201cGK\u201d bib. Think Diamonds superstars of past and present, like Laura Geitz, Liz Ellis and Sharni Layton.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/15/super-netball-the-circuit-breaker-the-game-has-been-crying-out-for\">Super Netball: the circuit-breaker the game has been crying out for</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the keeper and their direct opponent, the goal shooter, have the least territory to operate in \u2013 just a third of the court \u2013 their battle often shapes the result of the game. Generally speaking, it\u2019s the highest volume shooter versus one of the most dogged defenders. Whomever dominates, wins.</p> <h2><strong>The role</strong></h2> <p>Confined to their side\u2019s defensive third and pitted against the opposition\u2019s most accurate and prolific scorer, keepers, as in the world game, have the seemingly uncomplicated task of stopping goals.</p> <p>Keepers work in close partnership with the goal defence, who marks the goal attack, to push both shooters as far as possible from the post, making scoring difficult. They defend shots on goal, take throw-ins and penalties in the third and make attacking moves to drive the ball to the transverse line. They\u2019re also often the \u201cvoice\u201d of a team, as they can see the entire court and have less \u201con\u201d time than other players.</p> <p>They must have a borderline obsessive focus on one-on-one defence of the generally tall goal shooter, putting pressure on their body and their shots, whilst also pulling in rebounds. The very best are also brave enough \u2013 and read the game well enough \u2013 to \u201cgo hunting\u201d, netball parlance for coming off their player to look for an intercept. Such intercepts often swing momentum and change games.</p> <p>A keeper\u2019s alliance with their defensive partner, built on clear communication and a \u201cunit\u201d mentality, is key, as are their links with the wing defence and centre, who act as both defenders\u2019 eyes and ears on the circle edge.</p> <h2><strong>Key attributes</strong></h2> <p>The former Diamonds captain turned commentator, Liz Ellis, who played 122 Tests, mostly at keeper, tells Guardian Australia the key temperamental attributes for the position include intelligence, resilience, determination and \u201ca bit of mongrel.\u201d</p> <p>Only the supremely intelligent can play the position, she laughs. \u201cMy gut feeling is that keepers probably have more university degrees, per capita, than any other position.\u201d</p> <p>IQ aside, keepers \u201cneed plenty of resilience, because you end up as the patsy quite a bit,\u201d Ellis says, referring to balls sailing over keepers\u2019 heads or being left exposed by poor pressure out the front. \u201cYou need to be determined, prepared to go hard all day and wear someone down, to make someone\u2019s life difficult. You\u2019ve got to be annoying and have a bit of mongrel. Not like the lip-stick-wearing girls who shoot.\u201d</p> <p>Physically, height is an advantage, but not vital, 183cm Ellis says. \u201cI was never the tallest and I\u2019d argue good footwork is more important. It\u2019s footwork that gets you to the ball, footwork that gets you out of trouble and footwork that puts doubt in the throwers\u2019 mind, which create turnovers.\u201d Core strength, good elevation, speed off the mark and impeccable timing are other key weapons in a keeper\u2019s arsenal.</p> <p>Current Diamonds keeper and captain, Sharni Layton, who has also played wing defence and goal defence in her elite career, says keepers need to do the basics \u201cextremely well\u201d, be persistent and have a strong game sense. \u201cIn lots of ways, you\u2019re playing a game of chess with your opponent, so it\u2019s a mental game as well as physical,\u201d Layton says.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to work around the body and think about how to confuse the thrower. You need to constantly be on the move, using great footwork, but not \u2018over move\u2019 and I always want to be able to see the ball, my player and my goal defence. That\u2019s a lot to think about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"882d2010085eb91fd6c1d0202c18b5e09eaf3eab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/882d2010085eb91fd6c1d0202c18b5e09eaf3eab/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Magpies goal keeper Sharni Layton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Magpies goal keeper Sharni Layton competes for the ball with Romelda Aiken of the Firebirds during round two of Super Netball.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Hyde/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Lean, jump or baulk?</strong></h2> <p>While some coaches at grassroots level insist defenders always \u201chang\u201d on a shot, rather than attempt a timed jump to affect a basketball-style rejection or baulk to put shooters off their rhythm, Ellis and Layton agree it\u2019s situational.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a minute-by-minute proposition,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cEvery player is different. You know you can put some off with a particular approach, some hate when you lean, so you stay on the lean, while others dislike when you go into a crouch and are scared waiting for you to jump. You have to read the game and work out what\u2019s best in any given situation. A good goal keeper can think their way through a game.\u201d</p> <p>Layton says the past is often a good predictor of the future, but variety still reigns. \u201cIf I know what\u2019s worked previously on a player, I\u2019ll stick with that, but it\u2019s all trial and error,\u201d the 188cm Melbourne native, says. \u201cIf something is working, you keep doing that, if it\u2019s not, you have to be able to mix it up with a lean, a jump, even a windmill.\u201d Layton works on being able to hold a lean for at least five seconds \u2013 just like her childhood hero, Ellis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/16/the-guardians-guide-to-playing-netball-part-five-goal-attack\">The Guardian\u2019s guide to playing netball \u2013 part five: goal attack</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Communication is key</strong></h2> <p>The value of \u201cgetting on the same page with your goal defence\u201d can\u2019t be over-stated, Layton says. \u201cThat partnership is so key. You need to speak the same language. You need to understand each other\u2019s calls. When you call \u2018base\u2019 does that mean you want them to go to the base line or you are going base? Communication is the key to not leaving your mate high and dry.\u201d </p> <p>Layton is forming a formidable partnership with Collingwood team mate April Brandley at both international and domestic level.</p> <h2><strong>The unseen work</strong></h2> <p>Keepers often work \u201clong and hard with little reward\u201d, but when it comes it really matters, Ellis says. \u201cA lot of what a keeper does in a match, people don\u2019t necessarily see. The hassling, the footwork, the near-tips, working the ground, stepping up to your player. That might all pay zero dividends in the first half of a match. You might not get a single intercept.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you wear shooters down, players get tired, passes start missing and then the intercepts often come in the last quarter. That\u2019s what good goal keepers do.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "They\u2019re the self-styled anti-princesses of netball. They ones with skun knees and booming voices. The ones who hassle, hector and harangue. They\u2019re risk-takers who can be left looking the patsy. They\u2019re the last line of defence. Meet: the goal keepers. Goal keeper is one of netball\u2019s true \u201ckey\u201d positons. Like a centre-half forward in Australian rules football, theirs is a make-or-break role. They have an almost-unparalleled influence on a team\u2019s chances of success, so one of a side\u2019s most tenacious and \u201cgame smart\u201d players usually wears the \u201cGK\u201d bib. Think Diamonds superstars of past and present, like Laura Geitz, Liz Ellis and Sharni Layton. While the keeper and their direct opponent, the goal shooter, have the least territory to operate in \u2013 just a third of the court \u2013 their battle often shapes the result of the game. Generally speaking, it\u2019s the highest volume shooter versus one of the most dogged defenders. Whomever dominates, wins. The role Confined to their side\u2019s defensive third and pitted against the opposition\u2019s most accurate and prolific scorer, keepers, as in the world game, have the seemingly uncomplicated task of stopping goals. Keepers work in close partnership with the goal defence, who marks the goal attack, to push both shooters as far as possible from the post, making scoring difficult. They defend shots on goal, take throw-ins and penalties in the third and make attacking moves to drive the ball to the transverse line. They\u2019re also often the \u201cvoice\u201d of a team, as they can see the entire court and have less \u201con\u201d time than other players. They must have a borderline obsessive focus on one-on-one defence of the generally tall goal shooter, putting pressure on their body and their shots, whilst also pulling in rebounds. The very best are also brave enough \u2013 and read the game well enough \u2013 to \u201cgo hunting\u201d, netball parlance for coming off their player to look for an intercept. Such intercepts often swing momentum and change games. A keeper\u2019s alliance with their defensive partner, built on clear communication and a \u201cunit\u201d mentality, is key, as are their links with the wing defence and centre, who act as both defenders\u2019 eyes and ears on the circle edge. Key attributes The former Diamonds captain turned commentator, Liz Ellis, who played 122 Tests, mostly at keeper, tells Guardian Australia the key temperamental attributes for the position include intelligence, resilience, determination and \u201ca bit of mongrel.\u201d Only the supremely intelligent can play the position, she laughs. \u201cMy gut feeling is that keepers probably have more university degrees, per capita, than any other position.\u201d IQ aside, keepers \u201cneed plenty of resilience, because you end up as the patsy quite a bit,\u201d Ellis says, referring to balls sailing over keepers\u2019 heads or being left exposed by poor pressure out the front. \u201cYou need to be determined, prepared to go hard all day and wear someone down, to make someone\u2019s life difficult. You\u2019ve got to be annoying and have a bit of mongrel. Not like the lip-stick-wearing girls who shoot.\u201d Physically, height is an advantage, but not vital, 183cm Ellis says. \u201cI was never the tallest and I\u2019d argue good footwork is more important. It\u2019s footwork that gets you to the ball, footwork that gets you out of trouble and footwork that puts doubt in the throwers\u2019 mind, which create turnovers.\u201d Core strength, good elevation, speed off the mark and impeccable timing are other key weapons in a keeper\u2019s arsenal. Current Diamonds keeper and captain, Sharni Layton, who has also played wing defence and goal defence in her elite career, says keepers need to do the basics \u201cextremely well\u201d, be persistent and have a strong game sense. \u201cIn lots of ways, you\u2019re playing a game of chess with your opponent, so it\u2019s a mental game as well as physical,\u201d Layton says. \u201cYou need to work around the body and think about how to confuse the thrower. You need to constantly be on the move, using great footwork, but not \u2018over move\u2019 and I always want to be able to see the ball, my player and my goal defence. That\u2019s a lot to think about.\u201d Lean, jump or baulk? While some coaches at grassroots level insist defenders always \u201chang\u201d on a shot, rather than attempt a timed jump to affect a basketball-style rejection or baulk to put shooters off their rhythm, Ellis and Layton agree it\u2019s situational. \u201cIt\u2019s a minute-by-minute proposition,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cEvery player is different. You know you can put some off with a particular approach, some hate when you lean, so you stay on the lean, while others dislike when you go into a crouch and are scared waiting for you to jump. You have to read the game and work out what\u2019s best in any given situation. A good goal keeper can think their way through a game.\u201d Layton says the past is often a good predictor of the future, but variety still reigns. \u201cIf I know what\u2019s worked previously on a player, I\u2019ll stick with that, but it\u2019s all trial and error,\u201d the 188cm Melbourne native, says. \u201cIf something is working, you keep doing that, if it\u2019s not, you have to be able to mix it up with a lean, a jump, even a windmill.\u201d Layton works on being able to hold a lean for at least five seconds \u2013 just like her childhood hero, Ellis. Communication is key The value of \u201cgetting on the same page with your goal defence\u201d can\u2019t be over-stated, Layton says. \u201cThat partnership is so key. You need to speak the same language. You need to understand each other\u2019s calls. When you call \u2018base\u2019 does that mean you want them to go to the base line or you are going base? Communication is the key to not leaving your mate high and dry.\u201d Layton is forming a formidable partnership with Collingwood team mate April Brandley at both international and domestic level. The unseen work Keepers often work \u201clong and hard with little reward\u201d, but when it comes it really matters, Ellis says. \u201cA lot of what a keeper does in a match, people don\u2019t necessarily see. The hassling, the footwork, the near-tips, working the ground, stepping up to your player. That might all pay zero dividends in the first half of a match. You might not get a single intercept.\u201d \u201cBut you wear shooters down, players get tired, passes start missing and then the intercepts often come in the last quarter. That\u2019s what good goal keepers do.\u201d",

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for Sessions to recuse himself from any investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. \u201cIf reports are accurate that Attorney General Sessions \u2013 a prominent surrogate for Donald Trump \u2013 met with Ambassador Kislyak during the campaign, and failed to disclose this fact during his confirmation, it is essential that he recuse himself from any role in the investigation of Trump campaign ties to the Russians,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThis is not even a close call; it is a must.\u201d Asked by MSBNC on Thursday whether he would recuse himself from any investigations, Sessions said: \u201cWell I have said whenever it is appropriate I will recuse myself, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, issued a statement calling for Sessions\u2019s \u201cimmediate\u201d resignation. \u201cIt is inconceivable that even after Michael Flynn was fired for concealing his conversations with the Russians that Attorney General Sessions would keep his own conversations secret for several more weeks,\u201d Cummings said, adding Sessions\u2019s testimony was \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d. \u201cYet he let it stand for weeks \u2013 and he continued to let it stand even as he watched the president tell the entire nation he didn\u2019t know anything about anyone advising his campaign talking to the Russians.\u201d The revelation comes just two weeks after the resignation of Michael Flynn, who served as Trump\u2019s national security advisor until it was revealed he discussed US sanctions against Russia with Kislyak in December and misled Vice-President Mike Pence about the nature of his communications. As the new attorney general, Sessions will have significant oversight of an investigation by the FBI into Russia\u2019s role in the US election and any links to associates of Trump. The Senate and House intelligence committees are each conducting their own separate inquiries into the matter. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said Sessions should recuse himself from the FBI investigation. \u201cIf there is something there, and it goes up the chain of investigation, it is clear to me that Jeff Sessions, who is my dear friend, cannot make this decision about Trump,\u201d Graham said during a joint CNN townhall with Senator McCain late on Wednesday. Most Republicans have resisted calls to have an independent, select panel investigation the issue, arguing that the intelligence committees can be trusted to oversee the inquiries that were launched shortly after US officials accused Russia of meddling in the American election. But Democrats have called into question whether Trump\u2019s own party, which controls both chambers of Congress, will conduct a fair and thorough investigation. The Minnesota senator Al Franken, the Democrat who raised the issue of possible ties between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russians in Sessions\u2019 confirmation hearing, also called on the attorney general to recuse himself from any ongoing investigation. Franken said: \u201cI am very troubled that his response to my questioning during his confirmation hearing was, at best, misleading. \u201cThe American people deserve to know the truth about what happened between Russia and the Trump team \u2026 It\u2019s clearer than ever now that the attorney general cannot, in good faith, oversee an investigation at the department of justice and the FBI of the Trump-Russia connection, and he must recuse himself immediately.\u201d Trump\u2019s friendly posture toward Russia has sounded alarms across the US and frequently proved a source of consternation among members of his own party. The president has routinely praised his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Following his victory in November, Trump nominated Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state \u2013 a former CEO of ExxonMobil with close ties to Russia. Trump\u2019s administration has also refused to categorically rule out lifting sanctions imposed against Russia by the Obama administration, prompting bipartisan efforts to ratify those sanctions into law.",

The results come before a hearing on Friday to examine National Australia Bank witnesses; the second round of a new parliamentary committee process that has grilled the big four about financial planning and insurance scandals, credit card and mortgage interest rates, and donations to political parties.

But he challenged her to point to any negative language he\u2019d ever uttered on refugees. He acknowledged it was a toxic debate. Pauline Hanson had played her part in that, Shorten noted. He said Labor would always put One Nation last. He was pro-immigration.</p> <p>The substance of Helen\u2019s request was left to the local member Andrew Leigh. \u201cWe need to close down Manus and Nauru,\u201d Leigh said, to a holler and a whoop. It was \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d to say Labor and the Coalition were the same on refugees, Leigh said. The holler and a whoop wound down to a smattering of desultory applause.</p> <p>The microphone was passed to the other local member, Gai Brodtmann. Labor\u2019s platform was guided by compassion and a great sense of humanitarianism, she said. Brodtmann said a new consultation would begin on the refugee chapter of the Labor party platform \u2013 sixty people were involved in a consultation process.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/16/what-bill-shorten-and-labor-can-learn-from-the-election-of-donald-trump\">What Bill Shorten and Labor can learn from the election of Donald Trump | Stephen Koukoulas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The microphone went back to Shorten. \u201cWe will disagree with the government, but not just for the sake of it,\u201d he said, on refugees.</p> <p>A swerve back to Barnaby, who was forcing public servants to work out of McDonalds in Armidale. This was absurd, Shorten said. It was all because the Nationals were terrified of One Nation. The Labor leader\u2019s volume went up several notches. The Nationals were failing the bush. Yes, they were.</p> <p>Then to the thorny issue of the Buffett tax, which is a proposition supported by the Labor left, but not by the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen. Inequality is a problem, Shorten said. If you don\u2019t have a plan for inequality you shouldn\u2019t be in government.</p> <p>\u201cLabor does support a progressive tax system,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But a Buffett tax was a bridge too far. Probably. \u201cWe think that for sheer efficiency ... at this point reforming negative gearing is one of the best redistributive mechanisms we can do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe want to hear ideas. We are up for making genuine changes. We respect success but we shouldn\u2019t have a system that prioritises trickle down economics. We are on the right track, and we are going to push the fairness agenda every day until the next federal election because the country is ready for it.\u201d</p> <p>The next batch of questions.</p> <p>In the age of Q&amp;A, people no longer hesitate at the microphone. People take their moment. What are you doing to protect minorities such as Muslims? People are fearful, said one questioner.</p> <p>What would are you doing to eradicate gum trees? They are a bloody menace. (Yes, really). It was a lengthy presentation.</p> <p>Brodtmann counselled for concision. Nobody cared about concision. Another lengthy monologue followed on kinship care.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, I\u2019ll keep it brief,\u201d said the next lady. You are talking about what\u2019s happening at the next election, she said. What can we do now to keep people engaged? Now. Not in three years.</p> <p>The protection of minorities question was an opportunity to talk about the government and the 18C debate. And by the way, Labor would legislate for marriage equality within one hundred days. The segue between 18C and marriage equality wasn\u2019t entirely clear. (In any case, another roof lifting holler).</p> <p>Gum trees, sadly, would have to be left to the local assembly. Kinship care would have to be taken on notice.</p> <p>Now we\u2019d arrived at how you make change between elections. Shorten gestured in the direction of press gallery journalists. They might have some ideas. The room looked deeply unconvinced.

      "bodyText": "The grey clouds hung low, and it drizzled. A small band of protesters shouted for refugees. Bill Shorten swept down the aisle of the Albert Hall like he was in a wedding procession \u2013 with a couple of federal police groomsmen eyeing off the guests. Canberra is a progressive town. The moist attendees for the Labor leader\u2019s first Canberra \u201ctown hall\u201d meeting cheered their welcome. Shorten rocked on his heels at the podium at the front of the room. \u201cWhat I want to do is hear from you,\u201d the Labor leader told his audience. Just in case they missed it. \u201cWe want to hear from you.\u201d Up front, Shorten addressed the current disillusionment with politics-as-usual. The cause of productive engagement, politician to person, was more urgent than ever, Shorten reasoned, because people were sick of the \u201cschoolyard bickering.\u201d The people behind me murmured their approval. The Labor leader opened with a statement of values. He would try and roll back the Fair Work Commission decision on penalty rates. (Polite applause). Labor would take real action on climate change. (Roof lifting roar of approval). The microphones went out to the floor and Shorten\u2019s suit jacket came off. I mentioned Canberra was a progressive town. One of the first questions from the floor was about the incarceration of asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island. A woman wanted a commitment from Labor to bring together a cross-party coalition to change the \u201ctoxic\u201d nature of the debate, and a lot more besides. Her take down of Labor\u2019s bipartisanship on offshore detention was comprehensive. Another man was worried about lifelong learning. A lady was worried about \u201cBarnaby\u201d taking good workers out of the ACT. A young man from the inner north was worried about rising inequality. He wanted a rock solid commitment that Labor would support a progressive tax system. He\u2019d heard Wayne Swan on the radio talking about the \u201cBuffett rule.\u201d \u201cThanks very much everybody,\u201d Shorten said, possibly even meaning it, microphone in hand, liberating himself from out from behind the podium. The shirt sleeves were rolled up. Helen had made some good points on the refugee debate, Shorten said. But he challenged her to point to any negative language he\u2019d ever uttered on refugees. He acknowledged it was a toxic debate. Pauline Hanson had played her part in that, Shorten noted. He said Labor would always put One Nation last. He was pro-immigration. The substance of Helen\u2019s request was left to the local member Andrew Leigh. \u201cWe need to close down Manus and Nauru,\u201d Leigh said, to a holler and a whoop. It was \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d to say Labor and the Coalition were the same on refugees, Leigh said. The holler and a whoop wound down to a smattering of desultory applause. The microphone was passed to the other local member, Gai Brodtmann. Labor\u2019s platform was guided by compassion and a great sense of humanitarianism, she said. Brodtmann said a new consultation would begin on the refugee chapter of the Labor party platform \u2013 sixty people were involved in a consultation process. The microphone went back to Shorten. \u201cWe will disagree with the government, but not just for the sake of it,\u201d he said, on refugees. A swerve back to Barnaby, who was forcing public servants to work out of McDonalds in Armidale. This was absurd, Shorten said. It was all because the Nationals were terrified of One Nation. The Labor leader\u2019s volume went up several notches. The Nationals were failing the bush. Yes, they were. Then to the thorny issue of the Buffett tax, which is a proposition supported by the Labor left, but not by the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen. Inequality is a problem, Shorten said. If you don\u2019t have a plan for inequality you shouldn\u2019t be in government. \u201cLabor does support a progressive tax system,\u201d he said. But a Buffett tax was a bridge too far. Probably. \u201cWe think that for sheer efficiency ... at this point reforming negative gearing is one of the best redistributive mechanisms we can do.\u201d \u201cWe want to hear ideas. We are up for making genuine changes. We respect success but we shouldn\u2019t have a system that prioritises trickle down economics. We are on the right track, and we are going to push the fairness agenda every day until the next federal election because the country is ready for it.\u201d The next batch of questions. In the age of Q&amp;A, people no longer hesitate at the microphone. People take their moment. What are you doing to protect minorities such as Muslims? People are fearful, said one questioner. What would are you doing to eradicate gum trees? They are a bloody menace. (Yes, really). It was a lengthy presentation. Brodtmann counselled for concision. Nobody cared about concision. Another lengthy monologue followed on kinship care. \u201cThank you, I\u2019ll keep it brief,\u201d said the next lady. You are talking about what\u2019s happening at the next election, she said. What can we do now to keep people engaged? Now. Not in three years. The protection of minorities question was an opportunity to talk about the government and the 18C debate. And by the way, Labor would legislate for marriage equality within one hundred days. The segue between 18C and marriage equality wasn\u2019t entirely clear. (In any case, another roof lifting holler). Gum trees, sadly, would have to be left to the local assembly. Kinship care would have to be taken on notice. Now we\u2019d arrived at how you make change between elections. Shorten gestured in the direction of press gallery journalists. They might have some ideas. The room looked deeply unconvinced. Hostile eyes were directed to the front row at the Albert Hall. \u201cI\u2019m deeply conscious Labor didn\u2019t win the last election, but the opposition is standing up. You can fight and make a difference,\u201d Shorten said. Then back to the media. If the media want an adult conversation, then there needed to be adult reporting. Yes, yes, yes, said the room. Bloody oath. Shorten said if you want to make change, join a political party. \u201cJoin Labor.\u201d That advice seemed popular. Another batch of questions. The scourge of addictive drugs. The Adani coal mine, could Shorten guarantee there would be no public money for that project? Would he promise not to open new mines \u2013 would he stop the Queensland government from rolling out a disaster in Queensland? Then a child migrant, a victim of sexual abuse. The room hushed in respect. Heads turned back to look at the questioner. Shorten maintained steady eye contact. The man had concerns about the royal commission. He spoke for a long time. \u201cSir,\u201d Brodtmann inquired, gently, prompting a question. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d A child of diplomats was worried about the impact of foreign aid cuts.

Its reporters, who were given access to both detained men, claimed Xie said he was in good physical condition and was being treated well by prison guards who were giving him nine hours\u2019 sleep each day and \u201cdecent food\u201d. The Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper claimed Jiang had encouraged Xie\u2019s wife, Chen Guiqiu, to invent the torture claims. It alleged she did so believing that once such information was handed to foreign diplomats and reporters it would \u201cspread like wildfire\u201d. Foreign journalists were \u201cgreat enthusiasts\u201d for negative stories about the Chinese government and saw information about torture, human rights issues and the rule of law as \u201ctreasure\u201d, it added. David Bandurski, an expert on Chinese journalism from the University of Hong Kong, said Beijing had long used the concept of fake news (jia xinwen) to discredit reporting it did not approve of. \u201cFake news has been an accusation levelled at western media coverage of China for many, many years,\u201d he said, pointing to a 2009 article in Seeking Truth, the Communist party publication, that claimed foreign reporters were using fake news \u201cto blacken China\u2019s reputation\u201d. \u201cThere are many unfortunate parallels between the language used by Mr Trump on the media and the sorts of attacks we\u2019ve seen in authoritarian countries like China,\u201d Bandurski said. Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst for east Asia at the Freedom House advocacy group, said the attempt to cast Xie\u2019s alleged torture as fake news was part of an attempt to smear the lawyers and activists targeted by the crackdown. Beijing was using such articles \u201cto try to justify what they are doing to these very brave and courageous and generally honest people\u201d, she said. But Cook said China\u2019s fake news claim also underlined how Trump\u2019s use of the concept to discredit unwanted press coverage was being picked up by different authoritarian regimes and leaders and state media around the world. The US president\u2019s repeated attacks on the media not only made it harder for Washington to criticise press freedom violations elsewhere but also provided \u201ccover for regimes like the one in Beijing\u201d to attack the press, Cook said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m assuming they must be pretty pleased.\u201d Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based Amnesty International activist, said while China\u2019s state-run media routinely accused foreign counterparts of producing biased or inadequately sourced articles about the country, it was rare for the charge of fake news to be made. \u201cIt seems the Chinese media is borrowing the term from Donald Trump to discredit the western media,\u201d Poon said. \u201cIt is really worrying.\u201d Poon described the state media stories attacking the torture claims as unconvincing and full of inconsistencies. The reports about Xie\u2019s alleged torture published in the Guardian, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Asahi Shimbun were based on detailed transcripts of conversations between the prisoner and two of his lawyers, Chen Jiangang and Liu Zhengqing, that took place in January. Chinese reports did not directly refer to those stories or interviews but instead focused on four less detailed accounts that were published late last year by dissident-run human rights websites including China Free Press and Boxun. Cook said Xinhua\u2019s report appeared to have been at least partly fabricated and that China\u2019s claims about fake news appeared to be \u201ca propaganda strategy, to muddy the water surrounding these allegations\u201d of torture. \u201cThe whole thing strikes me as very suspicious,\u201d she said. Speaking to Reuters, Xie\u2019s lawyer Chen said his client\u2019s torture claims were genuine. Additional reporting by Wang Zhen",

It\u2019s possible this performance will create in some audience members a new empathy for Richard, but the most striking thing about Mulvany here isn\u2019t her posture: it\u2019s her tremendous malfeasance.</p> <p>Her Richard is voracious, always eating \u2013 strawberries and sweets \u2013 but never sated by food, blood or sexual conquest. Cruelly misogynist and self-obsessed, her Richard is nevertheless blessed with a great and sparking charm that\u2019s so pleasing you almost don\u2019t notice, or care, about his malevolence. </p> <p> It\u2019s no surprise that director Peter Evans, who is also Bell Shakespeare\u2019s artistic director, has sensed parallels between Richard\u2019s rise to power and the current global climate, and invited onstage an actor who can relate to the impact of disability on Richard\u2019s life.</p> <p> But in a Q&amp;A located in the show\u2019s program, he describes his new take as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bellshakespeare.com.au/whats-on/richard3/\">completely about Trump</a>\u201d. This never rings true onstage. It\u2019s a cohesive and confident production, nicely paced and well-performed. But Mulvany\u2019s Richard is so singular and subtle (per Shakespeare\u2019s frequent description of the man) that it doesn\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s highly public profile and bombast at all. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"615949d5785dd04cd87f5b55c620d5423b0f9334\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/615949d5785dd04cd87f5b55c620d5423b0f9334/0_0_2880_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Image from Bell Shakespeare\u2019s 2017 production of Richard III, directed by Peter Evans and featuring Kate Mulvaney as Richard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The aides of Richard III: shades of Robert Menzies\u2019 \u2018faceless men\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prudence Upton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> By confining the action to one room \u2013 part inner sanctum, part war room \u2013 Evans attempts to create a conveyor belt of machinations.

And with scene transitions marked by the ensemble singing English hymns, we have no sense of a connection to an American campaign; the direction remains stubbornly benign and devoted to a generic time and place.</p> <p> The male ensemble rotate through the smaller, expendable nobles all eventually destroyed by Richard, differentiating between character by removal of jacket or straightening a tie; shades of Robert Menzies\u2019 \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/politics/red-fox-exposed-partys-faceless-men/news-story/54982cc60489c547a994c0c16d5cffcf\">faceless men</a>\u201d, those unseen politicos making all the real decisions in swanky rooms, out of the eyes of the public \u2013 or perhaps it\u2019s reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/06/some-of-trumps-advisers-want-a-new-civil-war-we-must-not-let-them-have-it\">the advisers who circle Trump</a>, proffering opinion and expertise for Trump to use and then discard.</p> <p>The only constants are the women, who hold on to their own roles for the duration (with the exception of Rose Riley\u2019s delightful double-duty as Lady Anne and the young Prince). They all \u2013 Riley, Meredith Penman as Queen Elizabeth, Sandy Gore as Queen Margaret, and Sarah Woods as Duchess of York \u2013 deliver finely crafted, generously open-hearted performances.<br /></p> <p> In his speech at the opening night reception, Evans suggested this choice to keep the women in single roles \u2013 and, more broadly, his production as a whole \u2013 was designed to honour and highlight Shakespeare\u2019s women. This is separate from the casting choice of Mulvany as Richard, which is not a choice designed to challenge gender: Evans\u2019 production and Anna Cordingley\u2019s design is traditionally masculine \u2013 it seems to tell us Mulvany and Richard must not be read as female and not have Richard\u2019s kissing Lady Anne read as queer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"309b30abecaa2664163bf75cb448eae79cb2cb90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309b30abecaa2664163bf75cb448eae79cb2cb90/0_0_2880_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Image from Bell Shakespeare\u2019s 2017 production of Richard III, directed by Peter Evans and featuring Kate Mulvaney as Richard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evans\u2019 production and Anna Cordingley\u2019s design is traditionally masculine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prudence Upton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Of course, these women \u2013 full of pain and continually abused \u2013 are tools of emotional labour and manipulation in the story; you can\u2019t \u201cflesh out\u201d their roles beyond the text, and in the text they are there to serve as examples of Richard\u2019s brutality. The more you highlight the women, the more you highlight that they\u2019re little more than narrative punching bags.</p> <p> In his speech, Evans also apologised for his male voice on the microphone, as he wished to place more emphasis on women\u2019s voices in this production. If he truly meant that, as artistic director of Bell Shakespeare, he could have hired a woman to direct and therefore speak at opening night.</p> <p> Why make statements the production can\u2019t support?

      "bodyText": "Richard III, Shakespeare\u2019s tragi-history about a tyrant\u2019s rise to power, is inherently, though not potently, political. Richard\u2019s physical disabilities (notably, a hunched back) have rendered him a laughing stock, an un-serious prospect for ultimate rule. So he brilliantly and bloodily sets about proving everyone wrong \u2013 and he does it with a smile. Kate Mulvany, celebrated actor and writer, is Richard in this Bell Shakespeare production, and she\u2019s chilling. Childhood cancer left Mulvany with a spinal malformation she usually takes great pains to disguise on stage, but here she sheds tricks of costuming and light to perform as is, and force the audience to reckon with the physicality of Richard\u2019s life and disability. The play\u2019s villain is also its protagonist, walking us through Richard\u2019s unforgiving desire for, and rise to, terrifying power, and Mulvany revels in that rise. It\u2019s possible this performance will create in some audience members a new empathy for Richard, but the most striking thing about Mulvany here isn\u2019t her posture: it\u2019s her tremendous malfeasance. Her Richard is voracious, always eating \u2013 strawberries and sweets \u2013 but never sated by food, blood or sexual conquest. Cruelly misogynist and self-obsessed, her Richard is nevertheless blessed with a great and sparking charm that\u2019s so pleasing you almost don\u2019t notice, or care, about his malevolence. It\u2019s no surprise that director Peter Evans, who is also Bell Shakespeare\u2019s artistic director, has sensed parallels between Richard\u2019s rise to power and the current global climate, and invited onstage an actor who can relate to the impact of disability on Richard\u2019s life. But in a Q&amp;A located in the show\u2019s program, he describes his new take as \u201ccompletely about Trump\u201d. This never rings true onstage. It\u2019s a cohesive and confident production, nicely paced and well-performed. But Mulvany\u2019s Richard is so singular and subtle (per Shakespeare\u2019s frequent description of the man) that it doesn\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s highly public profile and bombast at all. By confining the action to one room \u2013 part inner sanctum, part war room \u2013 Evans attempts to create a conveyor belt of machinations. Every new advancement in Richard\u2019s human chess game is greeted with the same celebration, the exact same choreography down to the beat, but there are no visual or script-adjustment cues that nod to Trump\u2019s particular views of his opponents or the public. And with scene transitions marked by the ensemble singing English hymns, we have no sense of a connection to an American campaign; the direction remains stubbornly benign and devoted to a generic time and place. The male ensemble rotate through the smaller, expendable nobles all eventually destroyed by Richard, differentiating between character by removal of jacket or straightening a tie; shades of Robert Menzies\u2019 \u201cfaceless men\u201d, those unseen politicos making all the real decisions in swanky rooms, out of the eyes of the public \u2013 or perhaps it\u2019s reference to the advisers who circle Trump, proffering opinion and expertise for Trump to use and then discard. The only constants are the women, who hold on to their own roles for the duration (with the exception of Rose Riley\u2019s delightful double-duty as Lady Anne and the young Prince). They all \u2013 Riley, Meredith Penman as Queen Elizabeth, Sandy Gore as Queen Margaret, and Sarah Woods as Duchess of York \u2013 deliver finely crafted, generously open-hearted performances. In his speech at the opening night reception, Evans suggested this choice to keep the women in single roles \u2013 and, more broadly, his production as a whole \u2013 was designed to honour and highlight Shakespeare\u2019s women. This is separate from the casting choice of Mulvany as Richard, which is not a choice designed to challenge gender: Evans\u2019 production and Anna Cordingley\u2019s design is traditionally masculine \u2013 it seems to tell us Mulvany and Richard must not be read as female and not have Richard\u2019s kissing Lady Anne read as queer. Of course, these women \u2013 full of pain and continually abused \u2013 are tools of emotional labour and manipulation in the story; you can\u2019t \u201cflesh out\u201d their roles beyond the text, and in the text they are there to serve as examples of Richard\u2019s brutality. The more you highlight the women, the more you highlight that they\u2019re little more than narrative punching bags. In his speech, Evans also apologised for his male voice on the microphone, as he wished to place more emphasis on women\u2019s voices in this production. If he truly meant that, as artistic director of Bell Shakespeare, he could have hired a woman to direct and therefore speak at opening night. Why make statements the production can\u2019t support? Better not to do that and let this production play straight. It won\u2019t disappoint Shakespeare fans or students; Mulvany is astonishing, and the text is treated with clarity and care. But maybe lip service to relevance is all Shakespeare can be these days, especially in the context of a national classical company \u2013 how much room is there for real, immediate relevance, political or otherwise? Shakespeare\u2019s work has continuing appeal only because it reaches out more broadly beyond history and period settings, using emotional hooks to dramatise and emphasise the human and the emotional, even though the figures onstage are kings or fighting literal sword battles. Doubling down on any additional urgent relevance here, without radically re-situating the production or adapting the text, seems like an attempt to dress this up as something it isn\u2019t \u2013 something of genuine political importance. \u2022 Bell Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III is showing at the Sydney Opera House from 25 February until 1 April, Canberra Theatre Centre from 6\u201315 April, and Arts Centre Melbourne from 20 April until 7 May",

Officials from the CEFC told the Senate estimates a new coal-fired plant was not \u201cfinanceable\u201d without the government agreeing to indemnify the project against the future risk of a carbon price being introduced and against the cost of delays in the project prompted by likely community protest action. The CEFC is currently banned from investing in carbon capture and storage technology but the Turnbull government has flagged changing investment guidelines to allow \u201cclean\u201d coal projects to be eligible for support.",

Today:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Christopher Knaus reported that the office of the human services minister, Alan Tudge, mistakenly sent a journalist internal departmental briefings about a welfare recipient\u2019s personal circumstances, which included additional detail on her relationship and tax history. Labor is now referring the matter to the Australian federal police to determine whether it was the unauthorised use of information.<br /></strong></li> <li><strong>Question time was dominated by the Fair Work Commission\u2019s cut to penalty rates of some awards. Labor says the government could act but will not. The government says Labor used to support the commission\u2019s</strong><strong> decisions and now do not. Labor tried to suspend standing orders to no avail.</strong></li> <li><strong>LNP MP George Christensen has rejected senior government arguments that 18C is not a big issue, suggesting if the racial discrimination act was not changed it would be a breach of faith with Coalition voters.<br /></strong></li> <li><strong>The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, is still threatening to intervene as the dispute between sugar growers and the international miller company Wilmar continues. </strong></li> <li><strong>Barnaby Joyce also snuffed out Clive Palmer\u2019s hopes that his Waratah coal firm might get support from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation for a clean coal project. </strong></li> <li><strong>And Joyce and the education minister, Simon Birmingham, set up a review into rural and regional educational outcomes and training. </strong><br /></li> </ul> <p>Thanks to my brains trust, <strong>Paul Karp, Christopher Knaus </strong>and<strong> Katharine Murphy</strong>. <strong>Mike Bowers</strong>, sleep well.

I would expect that those parties who form the Coalition would not walk away from it. </p> <p>We should repeal, or at the very least amend, section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act sooner rather than later.</p> <p>Failure to do so will represent a <strong>fundamental breach of faith with our base.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p> Christensen knows how to wound.

Crucially this will include when a predator lies about his or her age to a child.<br /></p> <p>Since her daughter\u2019s death, Sonya Ryan has spoken to tens of thousands of school children and their families about the risk of online predators. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-02T02:02:42.965Z\">at 2.02am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b758c0e4b09c1763ef5384\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T23:30:05.910Z\">11.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>national disability insurance scheme savings fund</strong> \u2013 set up to quarantine savings from the uncertain omnibus bill \u2013 has just passed through the lower house.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T23:54:14.173Z\">at 11.54pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b757d8e4b09c1763ef5380\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T23:23:19.108Z\">11.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/knausc/status/837079824476733441\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">but says, in this case, woman&#39;s claims were &quot;unfounded&quot; and could make others worry they have not complied with own requirements. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/estimates?src=hash\">#estimates</a></p>&mdash; Christopher Knaus (@knausc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/knausc/status/837079824476733441\">March 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b75672e4b047c20d90478c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T23:21:37.201Z\">11.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> is asked why he promised to support the independent Fair Work Commission decision before the election and then changed his mind.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think you need to ask [Malcolm Turnbull].

Today: Christopher Knaus reported that the office of the human services minister, Alan Tudge, mistakenly sent a journalist internal departmental briefings about a welfare recipient\u2019s personal circumstances, which included additional detail on her relationship and tax history. Labor is now referring the matter to the Australian federal police to determine whether it was the unauthorised use of information. Question time was dominated by the Fair Work Commission\u2019s cut to penalty rates of some awards. Labor says the government could act but will not. The government says Labor used to support the commission\u2019s decisions and now do not. Labor tried to suspend standing orders to no avail. LNP MP George Christensen has rejected senior government arguments that 18C is not a big issue, suggesting if the racial discrimination act was not changed it would be a breach of faith with Coalition voters. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, is still threatening to intervene as the dispute between sugar growers and the international miller company Wilmar continues. Barnaby Joyce also snuffed out Clive Palmer\u2019s hopes that his Waratah coal firm might get support from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation for a clean coal project. And Joyce and the education minister, Simon Birmingham, set up a review into rural and regional educational outcomes and training. Thanks to my brains trust, Paul Karp, Christopher Knaus and Katharine Murphy. Mike Bowers, sleep well. I am running off to a podcast so stay tuned for that in coming days. We have no more parliament until 20 March, so see you back here then. In the meantime, here is some more Bowers magic. Hands across the aisle. Good night. Barnaby Joyce, speaking to David Speers on Sky, appears to rule out any support for a Clive Palmer-led clean coal power project. This is a reference to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation now taking submissions for clean coal projects, one of which might be owned by former politician Palmer. Joyce said yeah-nah, when Speers asks about support for a possible Palmer project. Something to do with his history, he mumbles. Something to do with his political party that lasted three weeks, he mumbles. Clive unfortunately has had a very bad day at the track. Barnaby Joyce again threatens to intervene in the sugar dispute after the Queensland LNP opposition\u2019s legislation to force a resolution between sugar growers and the Wilmar milling company. He again says a sugar code of conduct is a real option but there is no cabinet meeting so he cannot \u201ctelegraph\u201d his punches. Speaking of Joel Fitzgibbon, he has accused his shadow Barnaby Joyce of being all hat, no cowboy on the sugar dispute. Barnaby Joyce confirmed again today he is all hat, no cowboy. All spin, no substance. Last week he told Queensland cane growers he would intervene in their dispute with Wilmar if the Queensland parliament did not act this week. Joyce told cane growers: \u201cWe have options at the federal level.\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019ve got other cards up my sleeve and I\u2019ll play them at my will.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got other cards up my sleeve and I\u2019ll play them at my will.\u201d Last night the Queensland parliament chose not to intervene in the commercial stand-off. Today Barnaby Joyce led the second full-court-press of rural Liberals and Nationals in two days. Yesterday they announced a website, today they announced a review. George Christenson was not there. Barnaby Joyce is on the run but the member for Dawson has already bolted. Barnaby Joyce said nothing about sugar today until pressed by journalists. Queensland growers will be asking why. Labor loses the suspension motion on the numbers. Question time ends. Anthony Albanese notes today is the 21st anniversary of the class of 1996. That is, the MPs who came into parliament in that year, when John Howard won office. It includes Albo, Joel Fitzgibbon and Jenny Macklin. Then Albo starts a speech on a matter of public importance on public infrastructure - his personal passion. One of the good things about being in government is you have access to some very smart people... Thanks mate, says Joel Fitzgibbon. Strategist in chief Christopher Pyne. The House is now voting on Labor\u2019s motion to suspend standing orders to debate penalty cuts. Malcolm Turnbull also repeats his points in reply. The commissioners on the Fair Work Commission were appointed by Labor. Labor made the reference to the commission. The president Iain Ross has worked for the ACTU. He is hardly an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d. What he is seeking to do yet again is turn Australians against each other, turn workers against business, divide the country, stifle investment, stifle employment, all in his campaign to do anything to secure an election to government on the basis of a populist antibusiness campaign. He has no principle, no consistency, no integrity. It was not his finest performance. Labor shadow employment spokesman Brendan O\u2019Connor starts his speech with: Wakey, wakey. Bill Shorten says grandfathering the penalty rate decision, proposed by Eric Abetz \u201cthe ghost of banquets past\u201d, is not the solution. There is no government worth its salt in this country that could sit on its hands and do nothing. We will fight this issue in the house ... we will fight it all the way to the next election. So Labor\u2019s campaign is, as Tony Burke said earlier today: Workers face pay cuts. The government can fix it. The government is choosing not to. Bill Shorten says this pay cut could not have come at a worse time for workers. He says this is about real people\u2019s lives. When Turnbull is asked, he throws his hands up and says it is not my problem. Shorten \u201cadmits\u201d the big end of town had done well out of this government. But the penalty rate cut will disproportionately hit the young, he says. He talks about the effect on women of the cuts, not to mention the regions. What have the regions ever done to deserve Barnaby Joyce? Shorten says the National party is simply hostage to One Nation. Bill Shorten tries to suspend standing orders mid-question. He is told to wait until the PM has finished his answer. On penalty rates, obvs. Shorten to Turnbull: Today the prime minister has heard from just some of the nearly 700,000 Australians who will have their pay cut because of the prime minister\u2019s support for the penalty rates decision. The prime minister has the power to stop this decision and he won\u2019t stop the cuts. Why is this prime minister doing everything he can to give big business a tax cut but doing absolutely nothing to stop workers getting a pay cut? Turnbull says Shorten constantly traded away penalty rates as a union leader. He quotes a report in the Oz that the workers effected are around 286,000 rather than 700,000. That is a very substantial number but it is not 700,000. It shows the way the honourable member is loose with the truth. I can feel a suspension of standing orders coming on. Labor to Turnbull: Ruby lives in my electorate and works two casual jobs whilst studying part-time at university. She says she works in retail on Sundays because it makes a huge difference to her low income. She says this pay cut would be devastating and the owner of the business will just keep the money taken from her pay. Why won\u2019t the prime minister stand up for the penalty rates of workers like Ruby and use his power to stop the pay cut? Turnbull says again, Labor has to work out whether it supports the independent umpire. He says the FWC is working out how to phase in the penalty rate cuts. When modern awards began in 2010 under Bill Shorten as industrial relations minister, the phase-in period was five years. It is a longstanding practice to ensure that the objective of modern awards, namely that changes don\u2019t result in a reduction in take-home pay. Just a reminder. Work Choices 1.0. Labor to Turnbull: Linda lives in my electorate and she works on Sundays as a hotel chef because her rent is more than half her wages and she needs the money. Linda previously relied on Centrelink but re-skilled to become a chef and she is proud she got off Centrelink and into a job. Linda can\u2019t understand why the Turnbull government wants to cut her wages. Why, when the prime minister has the power to act, is he refusing to stop Linda\u2019s pay cut? Turnbull: I trust the honourable member will be advising her constituent that the decision about penalty rates is not a decision of the government. What the honourable member said in her question is quite misleading. It is a decision of the Fair Work Commission. Shorten to Turnbull: Margarita is a single mum with two children who regularly works Sundays at a hotel. The Sunday penalty rates help her put food on the table, buy shoes for her kids. She stands to lose thousands in take-home pay. She says, \u201cEverything is getting more difficult. The bills go up so why is our wages going down? Where is the balance? \u201c Can the prime minister explain why he is willing to intervene in the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, the CFA decision, but will do nothing to stop Margarita\u2019s pay cut? (This is already feeling like Work Choices 2.0.) Turnbull: The lady that the honourable member refers to, Margarita, may be affected in the manner he describes by the penalty rate change. We have learnt not to take our critical assertions of fact from the opposition but the fact is that the leader of the opposition, again and again and again, stated that he would support the decision of this Fair Work Commission. He gave them the reference to look at penalty rates. NXT MP Rebekha Sharkie to Turnbull: It was revealed in Senate estimates yesterday that 75% of the contents of ration packs for Aussie diggers are foreign produced, including items such as biscuits, fruit cake, tea, coffee and tomato sauce. Even the toilet paper is from China. Does the prime minister agree that Australian troops serving our country should be supplied with Australian goods in their ration packs, which would support Aussie food manufacturing, and if so how would the government rectify this situation? Turnbull: The revised commonwealth procurement rules came into affect on 1 March or come into affect on 1 March this year and Senator Xenophon advocated for the changes. The commonwealth is required to assess the economic benefit to the Australian economy of each procurement. I am advised the vast majority of items in ADF ration packs are Australian and New Zealand products. Labor\u2019s Linda Burney to Turnbull: Terry works in a news agent in my electorate. He works on Sundays and sacrifices time with his family and friends at important events like birthdays to provide for his partner and a four-and-a-half-year-old son. Terry stands to lose almost $4,000 a year because of the prime minister\u2019s support for cutting penalty rates. He says the cut to penalty rates will just mean the same work for less money. Why won\u2019t the prime minister use his power to stop Terry\u2019s pay cut? Turnbull says the government is standing up for the independent umpire. Government questions so far have been on the importance of economic growth and the national accounts. Labor\u2019s Tony Burke to Turnbull: (delivered in droll style) We all know what the prime minister meant when he said he supports the decision. What government policy was the prime minister referring to this morning when he said There\u2019s the, there\u2019s no question for you if you, um, the evidence is strong that you, you have lower penalty rates or on a Sunday public holiday there is less or more incentive if you like. It is more affordable for businesses to employ people, that is common sense, that is one consideration\u201d. Don\u2019t Australian workers deserve better than that? Turnbull cops the joke. I thank the honourable member for his comic interlude and recall on the subject of penalty rates his time as an organiser for the STA, the shop distributive and allied trades union. In those times the SDA negotiated one trade away of penalty rates after another. Turnbull says the FWC have done a \u201cgood and thorough job\u201d, which sounds like support. In the style of finance department video: Labor to Turnbull: Today, the prime minister said, \u201cIt is an element in a part of every modern award that it is the intention that any changes to awards will not reduce the take-home pay of employees but last week\u2019s penalty rates decision will reduce take-home pay\u201d. The prime minister has the power to fix this problem. Why won\u2019t he and when will the prime minister join with Labor to change the law so the take-home pay of all workers is not cut? Turnbull goes to the enterprise bargaining agreements negotiated under Shorten as a union leader. He quotes the clause referenced in the FWC decision. That neither the making of the award nor the operation of transitional agreements is intended to result in a reduction in the take home pay of employees. Question time in 5,4,3,2,1. Christopher Knaus reports: The office of the human services minister, Alan Tudge, mistakenly sent a journalist internal departmental briefings about a welfare recipient\u2019s personal circumstances, which included additional detail on her relationship and tax history. Senior departmental figures were grilled at Senate estimates on Thursday about the release of welfare recipient Andie Fox\u2019s personal information last month. Fox had written an opinion piece critical of Centrelink and its handling of her debt, which ran in Fairfax Media in February. The government released her personal details to Fairfax journalist Paul Malone, who subsequently published a piece attacking Fox and questioning the veracity of her claims. Two responses were given to the journalist, one from the Department of Human Services and the other from Tudge. The department said its response \u2013 three dot points containing only minimal detail on Fox\u2019s personal history \u2013 was cleared by lawyers and was lawful. The minister\u2019s office then added two quotes from Tudge and sent its own response to Malone. Guardian Australia can now reveal that the minister\u2019s office also accidentally sent the journalist two internal briefing documents, marked \u201cfor official use only\u201d, which had been prepared by the department. I have been running all morning but there has been only limited forward movement. George Christensen has warned if the Coalition does not amend 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, it will be a breach of faith with the Coalition base. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has ended a labour agreement begun under the Gillard government to allow fast food chains to employ 457 visa foreign workers. Dutton batted away questions of leadership conspiracies after he was spotted on his usual exercise routine with the finance minister, Mathias Cormann. The former Abbott workplace minister Eric Abetz suggested penalty cuts should be grandfathered but his prime minister said the Fair Work Commission had already stated it did not like grandfathering arrangements but the cuts would be phased in. A law to amend the criminal code to protect children from online predators, negotiated by the Nick Xenophon Team, was accepted by government. It will be called Carly\u2019s law after 15-year-old Carly Ryan who was lured to her death by an online predator. A review into regional, rural and remote education has been established by the Turnbull government. Barnaby Joyce\u2019s shadow. @fitzhunter is Joel Fitzgibbon, Labor agriculture spokesman. There is another mass Nat pack press conference down in the courtyard to announce a comprehensive review of regional education. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, who appears to be the only Lib attending, says the point is to improve school outcomes and encourage regional, rural and remote (RRR) students onto further study, training and employment. The independent review into regional, rural and remote education will be led by emeritus professor John Halsey of Flinders University. I have lost vision of it, so I hope to bring you more as I see it. For those who are interested, I blog in an office in the building and, in order to bring this to you in a timely manner, I cannot physically attend press conferences. Pardon me. Computer crash allowed me to grab sustenance. In the meantime, George Christensen has lobbed a statement into the middle of the leadership\u2019s daily plans. It specifically references the treasurer, Scott Morrison, brushing off concerns about the conservative push to change the Racial Discrimination Act. Morrison said such a change would not create a single job \u2013 which was his main concern in his role. Some of the arguments put forward for failing to act on the issue of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act are a nonsense. I have heard it stated that \u2018this issue doesn\u2019t create one job\u2019. Neither does the omnibus savings and childcare reform bill but we\u2019re still doing that. I have also heard it said that it\u2019s not the issue people are talking about in pubs or in farm sheds. They weren\u2019t talking about the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) either but we still brought it back. Section 18C is political correctness enshrined into law, and it stifles freedom of speech in Australia. Nothing could be more of an affront to Australian values. And nothing could be more at odds with National and Liberal party values. The National party constitution states that one of the party\u2019s objectives is \u2018the maintenance of democracy and liberty\u2019. A fundamental Liberal party value is that \u2018We believe in those most basic freedoms of parliamentary democracy \u2013 the freedom of thought, worship, speech and association\u2019. And where this issue definitely is being talked about is at local party meetings and state conventions. It\u2019s an issue of great importance for the people who fundraise for us, who hand out how-to-vote cards for us and who preselect us so that we can stand as candidates and serve our electorates. As far as I\u2019m concerned this is a fundamental issue not only for democracy but for the base of the Liberal and National parties. I would expect that those parties who form the Coalition would not walk away from it. We should repeal, or at the very least amend, section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act sooner rather than later. Failure to do so will represent a fundamental breach of faith with our base. Christensen knows how to wound. If you haven\u2019t already, I suggest you read up on him, with a piece by colleague Joshua Robertson prepared earlier. John Ferguson of the Oz reports: Former Howard government minister Peter Reith has nominated to contest the Victorian Liberal party presidency. The Australian understands his nomination has been lodged this morning, opening the way for a bitter battle with incumbent president Michael Kroger. The ballot will be held on April 1 and will lead to inevitable instability on the party as the warring camps seek the position. It is the first time in decades that the position has been contested by two party heavyweights of the standing of Mr Reith and Mr Kroger. Let the games begin. There have been questions in the estimates committee, about foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop\u2019s attendance at the Portsea Polo in 2016 which she charged to the taxpayer. Asked about the trip earlier this year when the Sussan Ley expense scandal broke, Bishop issued a statement: The minister was invited and attended in her official capacity as minister for foreign affairs and deputy leader of the Liberal party. The questions revolve around her attendance and its \u201cofficial\u201d capacity and why she cancelled her 2017 visit to the annual event. George Brandis, as the minister in the chair with the department officials, defended her visiting \u201cimportant national events\u201d like the Melbourne Cup. The department take most of the questions on notice which means they will return with answers at a later time. Last night, Barnaby Joyce spoke at the launch of the National Rural Press Club. It occurred in the Nationals\u2019 party room. Notwithstanding its location, it was a bipartisan event organised by The Land journalist Colin Bettles. It included speakers such as the Labor senator Glenn Sterle, the Greens senator Janet Rice, the Indi independent Cathy McGowan and the keynote speaker, Joyce. (In the interests of disclosure, AFR journo Phil Coorey and I also spoke briefly.) Joyce told the crowd that it was very important to speak to the press and explain policies in order to engage with voters. In a cheeky speech, McGowan said she hoped more independents like her would create greater competition in rural and regional NSW and particularly mentioned Queensland, perhaps for the benefit of the recently de-whipped George Christensen, who was in the back of the room. While McGowan was speaking, the Victorian Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie walked in, visibly horrified at McGowan at the lectern in the sacred space. While I am not a lip reader, she mouthed to her colleague something along the lines of \u201cwhat is she doing here?\u201d McGowan batted on, as a bit of wing-fluffing occurred at the back of the room. Then she took the opportunity to grab the number of the deputy PM. Carly\u2019s law. Sonya Ryan, the justice minister, Michael Keenan, Nick Xenophon, Skye Kakoschke-Moore and Derryn Hinch marked the 10-year anniversary of her death with the unveiling of a memorial quilt, made from Carly\u2019s favourite clothes. More on Centrelink. Just another middle-aged bloke trying to lose weight. The Senate crossbenchers Nick Xenophon and Skye Kakoschke-Moore have negotiated an amendment to the criminal code that is known as Carly\u2019s law. It is due to come to the parliament this morning. This is the amendment. Acts done in preparation for, or planning to, cause harm to or engage in sexual activity with a minor (1) A person (the defendant) commits an offence if the person uses a carriage service to do any act in preparation for, or planning to: (a) cause harm to a person under the age of 16; or (b) engage in sexual activity with a person under the age of 16; or (c) procure a person under the age of 16 to engage in sexual activity, and (2) the defendant is at least 18 years of age. Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years. Xenophon has been pushing for this law since 2o13 after a campaign by Sonya Ryan, the mother of 15-year-old Carly Ryan, who became the first person murdered in Australia by an online predator. Her murderer was a 50-year-old paedophile who posed as a 20-year-old to lure Carly to a meeting. The senator says the new laws fill a gap in the criminal code by allowing police to intervene when a predator is preparing to cause harm. Crucially this will include when a predator lies about his or her age to a child. Since her daughter\u2019s death, Sonya Ryan has spoken to tens of thousands of school children and their families about the risk of online predators. The national disability insurance scheme savings fund \u2013 set up to quarantine savings from the uncertain omnibus bill \u2013 has just passed through the lower house. Bill Shorten is asked why he promised to support the independent Fair Work Commission decision before the election and then changed his mind. I think you need to ask [Malcolm Turnbull]. When the remuneration tribunal for truck drivers made a decision he didn\u2019t like, he didn\u2019t just overrule the decision, he sacked the tribunal. Not a lot of respect for the independent umpire was there then. Or when the [Country Fire Authority] negotiated an enterprise agreement with professional firefighters last year, Malcolm Turnbull passed a law to overturn the enterprise agreement. A federal court is the independent umpire, isn\u2019t it? And on native title, we had a debate last week where the government wants to overturn a decision. This is a government who is very selective about which decisions it takes action on. Bill Shorten says it is a dumb idea to phase in penalty rate cuts through a grandfathering provision. Employers will just roster the cheaper worker ahead of the more expensive worker. The problem is if you are a small business or a big business and you have the choice of rostering someone at eight hours on a Sunday at double time or rostering someone for eight hours on a Sunday for time and a half, you don\u2019t need to be a Rhodes scholar to work out what will happen. This is a government desperate to cover a smokescreen. (The FWC have said they don\u2019t support grandfathering.) Shorten does not address the concept of phasing in the rate cut for everyone over time. Bill Shorten is speaking in a workplace of some sort. He addresses the government\u2019s attacks that he bargained away penalty rates. He says deals he negotiated increased workers\u2019 overall pay. Q: When you were the head of AWU, did you bargain away penalty rates? Look, I\u2019ve watched the government attacking me for standing up for workers. I will back my record for protecting workers\u2019 rights and conditions against Malcolm Turnbull and his whole frontbench any day of the week. Malcolm Turnbull has been trying to look at union deals, negotiated on behalf of workers, approved by the Fair Work Commission, which see people increase their overall pay. There is peak derp happening today. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, the man with the tan and the plan, is talking about his crackdown on 457 visas used in fast-food outlets. PDuddy\u2019s meditations on immigration policy are interrupted by leadership questions. Q: Do you have leadership aspirations? I have dealt with that. My loyalty was to Tony Abbott when I served in his cabinet. My loyalty is to Malcolm Turnbull. I serve in his cabinet because I believe in him as leader and I want all my colleagues to do everything within their power to make sure the government succeeds, the prime minister succeeds. That is what I pledge myself to and I want to make sure that overall, we do not get Bill Shorten at the next election. Q: Why then were you seen going for a walk with WA powerbroker Mathias Cormann? He is a close friend of mine and has been for a long time. He was my shadow health parliamentary secretary. So I have had a close friendship. I go to the gym, I am sorry it doesn\u2019t show but I do exercise a fair bit. And he, like me, wants to lose a fair bit of weight. I am not sure if that accords with your conspiracy theory but two middle-age blokes trying to lose weight, I am not sure you can speculate on that. I had this vague feeling that I was missing something, with Senate estimates committees rolling here. Then I realised it was actually the parliament. *hits forehead on desk* So the lower house began at 9.30am with government business. First cab off the rank is NDIS savings account, designed to squirrel away savings from the omnibus bill for the NDIS. These are the bits of legislation on the list today. National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 1) Veterans\u2019 Affairs Legislation Amendment (Digital Readiness and Other Measures) Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) On Centrelink: Tony Burke has been prosecuting Labor\u2019s penalty rate argument on Sky news. It looks like a dry run for a 2018 election slogan. Workers face pay cuts. The government can fix it. The government is choosing not to. Regarding the Centrelink release of personal information on a critic of the system: The background is here. Welfare recipient Andie Fox wrote an article for Fairfax Media earlier this month setting out her difficulties dealing with the agency after she began receiving calls from a debt collector. But, over the weekend, she was shocked to discover details of her interactions with Centrelink and claim history set out \u2013 with some information she says is incorrect \u2013 in a separate article by Fairfax Media. Penny Wong and her eyebrows are questioning the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Frances Adamson, on the global heads of missions meetings, which were revealed by the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop. This is the inaugural global heads of missions meetings where more than 100 ambassadors and heads of mission are brought back to Australia to discuss the government\u2019s foreign white paper. Adamson says it was her idea. Wong wants to know what the outcome of the meeting will be. Adamson says the outcome will be fed into the white paper. Wong wants to know if there will be a formal report process. My colleague Christopher Knaus is watching the the community affairs estimates. He did some great work on this over the Christmas period so he is worth following. One of the issues that has lobbed back on to the prime ministerial plate is 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. This happened after the report this week basically came up with every single option, from procedural changes to removing \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d. There was a prize for every child. Again it bounces back to the leadership group. Scott Morrison has been quite forthright on this. A change to the act won\u2019t create a single job, says the treasurer (ie, colleague frolic). Turnbull does a bit of conservative whispering, pointing out he defended Peter Wright in the Spycatcher case \u2013 a case that was about a former British spy\u2019s right to free speech. This is a very legitimate area to discuss, to debate. Scott\u2019s right. It\u2019s not going to result in people making another investment and taking on more employees. But nonetheless, we are here in a house of freedom in Parliament House, a house of democracy, and these issues are important. Malcolm Turnbull has been asked, do you think Tony Abbott\u2019s intent on blowing up this government? I\u2019ll decline the opportunity to comment on personalities. (This comes after Turnbull blamed Abbott for the bad Newspoll results this week.) Here is that quote from treasurer Scott Morrison on not spending any excess windfall in government revenue. Q: There is no temptation to spend it? John [Fraser] is right. That is government actual fiscal policy. Malcolm Turnbull lauds the national accounts figures while acknowledging that there are still parts of the country that are doing it tough. (Hello, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia.) There\u2019s no doubt that parts of regional Australia \u2013 not all, but parts \u2013 of regional Australia have done it tough, largely because of the downturn in the mining and construction boom. You know, we have seen in this last quarter a pick-up in business investment which is a very good sign, but obviously \u2026 investment in mining was up to 8% of GDP. It couldn\u2019t stay there forever. It came off and that\u2019s hit some regional areas very hard. Now, the good news is that because we are growing our exports. And you saw on the weekend I secured greater access for sugar and for beef into Indonesia \u2026 it\u2019s a huge market. Malcolm Turnbull makes a couple of points. The Fair Work Commission reduced some penalty rates, typically from 250% to 225% or 175% to 150%. Modern awards state an intention that any changes to awards will not reduce the take-home pay of employees. That is the take-home pay clause in every modern award. And the commission is now seeking submissions as to how to manage the transitional arrangements. [The FWC] have said that they do not support what\u2019s called red circling, which is where you would say that employee A\u2019s penalty rate remains the same but new employees, B, C, D, would be under the new arrangements. Which sounds like the PM does not support Abetz\u2019s option of grandfathering. It depends what you mean by grandfathering? They\u2019ve said they\u2019re not in favour of that. They\u2019ve indicated that provisionally. They have asked for submissions on how the take-home pay orders could be conducted. He says the FWC supports a phased-in transition so that as wages rise and penalty rates fall, it evens out in the pay packet. They have said \u2013 and this is consistent with the practice in the past \u2013 is that the changes to penalty rates should be phased in over a period of years \u2026The employee\u2019s overall pay packet increases and offsets the phased-in reduction in penalty rates. Malcolm Turnbull is speaking to Sabra Lane on AM. He will not be giving an opinion on whether the government supports the penalty rate cut. If you\u2019re asking me do I think that the penalty rate for a public holiday should be reduced in one award from 250% to 225%, that is a matter that the government has not decided. That is a matter for the Fair Work Commission. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, has hardened his line on any increase in government revenue from commodity prices. Yesterday, after the hopeful national accounts, Morrison was a little coy about what he would do with any coming windfall. If you were with me yesterday, you will know the the Treasury secretary, John Fraser, was clear cut in estimates hearings. Bank the savings, he said. As Peter Martin at Fairfax reports: Mr Fraser told the committee that if the terms of trade stayed high, the government should \u201cprioritise budget repair and ensure that any additional revenue is banked as an improvement to the budget bottom line\u201d. \u201cWe need to take great care not to fall into the trap of spending unexpectedly higher revenue, should it arise, in a way that would structurally weaken the budget as may have occurred through the early 2000s,\u201d he said. Morrison told Kieran Gilbert on Sky that if there was an improvement \u2013 and it was not clear that there was \u2013 it would go to paying down the debt. He made the point that he didn\u2019t want to chase revenue up hill and down dale. I will have the quotes to you Asap but there is a lot happening here this morning. The prime minister coming up. Good morning blogans, As you rub the sleep from your eyes, in this parallel universe of Australian politics, Eric Abetz has suggested no worker should be worse off under the penalty rate cut. Unlike the senior levels of the Coalition, he unequivocally supported the decision: I am pleased that the Fair Work Commission made the decision that it did. But: It\u2019s now important that the Fair Work Commission\u2019s decision is implemented in a fair and equitable manner for current workers in the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors. This approach would ensure that \u201cno worker is worse off\u201d while allowing new opportunities for the unemployed and especially for young unemployed people. It would mean no existing worker would have their income or household budget adversely impacted while supporting small business and assisting the unemployed.\u201d Abetz\u2019s argument is that the FWC has powers under the Fair Work Act to grandfather current employees covered by the modern awards mentioned in its recent four-yearly review of modern awards \u2013 penalty rates, with the new award rates applying only to prospective employees. He goes right to the point that is now under contention, that is how to implement the cut, remembering that Labor and the Greens are still trying to block the effect of the decision in parliament. Talk to me in the thread or on the Twits @gabriellechan or at Facebook. The man with the lens is @mpbowers. The prime minister is coming up. Up, up and away.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s cash rate will fall to 1% this year and the dollar will drop sharply thanks to factors including falling Chinese demand for Australian property and Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, a leading economist has warned. Despite a bounce in growth in the last quarter of 2016 and a surge in commodity prices, the Australian economy will face stronger headwinds in 2017, forcing the Reserve Bank to reduce borrowing costs, according to Paul Dales, chief Australia and New Zealand economist for Capital Economics. Speaking at the consultancy\u2019s annual conference in Sydney, Dales said a forecast slowdown in the Chinese economy this year would reverse the recent surge in commodity prices, in turn affecting demand for Australian housing and prices. \u201cThe housing market won\u2019t support GDP as much as in recent years,\u201d he said, arguing the RBA had overestimated the strength of the economy. Far from some market expectations of a rate rise this year, he said governor Philip Lowe would have to cut the cash rate from 1.5% to as low as 1% to keep inflation above its 2% target. \u201cThe RBA won\u2019t raise rates in 2017 or likely in 2018, and I wouldn\u2019t be putting much money on a hike in 2019 either. In fact, with the housing market slowing, the labour market weakening and inflation staying below target it\u2019s possible that there will be cuts this year to 1%. \u201cWe also think the Australian dollar could fall from US77c today to around US65c because of RBA rate cuts, a stronger US dollar [thanks to Trump\u2019s expansionary plans for the world\u2019s biggest economy] and falling commodity prices.\u201d Australia\u2019s terms of trade improved by 20% in 2016, Dales said, encouraging the RBA to forecast a doubling of wage growth from its current all-time low of below 2%. This was based on the expectation that the 20% surge in corporate profitability recorded in the last quarter of 2016 would trickle back into the economy. But Dales argued that spare capacity, excess labour supply and the pressure on mining companies to return profits to shareholders would see the benefits flood overseas. At the same time, Capital Economics saw a weakening in the Chinese economy in 2017 as last year\u2019s huge monetary stimulus wore off and the government increased its efforts to rein in a years-long credit binge that has seen total debt balloon to almost 250% of GDP. The implications for Australia were important, he said, especially in the property market which has continued to defy expectations of a slowdown by posting double- figure price rises in Sydney and Melbourne last year. \u201cIt can\u2019t go on much longer,\u201d said Dales. \u201cThe banks are tightening lending and raising mortgage rates so the market will slow down.\u201d It was difficult to measure the impact of overseas demand for Australian housing, he said, but it accounted for 20% of the value of all tranactions in the financial year 2014/15. Chinese purchases were a \u201cbig chunk\u201d of that figure and had been boosted by a sharp fall in the yuan relative to the dollar in that period which meant the price of Australian property fell in yuan terms. But the recent recovery of the yuan had made Australian property 16% more expensive to Chinese buyers and, combined with a tightening of lending standards and higher mortgage rates from banks, would curb prices. Capital\u2019s China economist, Julian Evans-Pritchard, told the audience that the crackdown on the amount of cash people could take out of the country would also have a significant impact.",

It\u2019s like a room for someone who has no star-sign. The soft furnishings are in neutral colours and there are large windows looking out over to the University of Technology Sydney and Ultimo. The art on the walls is so inoffensive that I have no recollection of it as soon as I check out.</p> <p>The room is spacious and light and I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone regardless of their star sign or even if they think astrology is a load of rubbish \u2013 because it is actually very nice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"914c116872ff2f53792d5901c0131ab2de11a3e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/914c116872ff2f53792d5901c0131ab2de11a3e3/0_202_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ultimo hotel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">These are my beige, soft furnishing years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nikki To/The Ultimo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of the service at the hotel is a personal reading with the hotel\u2019s resident astrologer, Damian.</p> <p>After we discuss that my reading may be inexact because of no one knowing when I was born, he asks: \u201cHow was your stay?

      "bodyText": "Hey Brigid, Hope you had a nice weekend. Any news re your birth time? Cheers. This is stressful. I am checking into the Ultimo hotel in Sydney, the \u201cworld\u2019s first astrology hotel\u201d, and need to provide the exact time I was born. Only problem: no one can remember when I was born. \u201cIt was before lunch,\u201d says my dad. \u201cBut after breakfast.\u201d \u201cI was born at brunch time,\u201d I tell hotel staff. \u201cMaybe 11am? Maybe 11.30am?\u201d But they want to know the exact time. As well as assigning you a room based on your star sign, the hotel provides a package where you get a one-on-one consultation (or \u201creading\u201d, in astrology parlance) with the hotel\u2019s astrologer. It doesn\u2019t work if you are vague. How will they know whether you\u2019re Capricorn or Aquarius rising? Even 10 minutes makes a difference to your character and your destiny. At check-in, I\u2019m given a room key, my personalised astrology chart and a guide to where to go in Sydney based on my star sign: China Doll, Sepia, Icebergs in Bondi and Redleaf pool. All fine places. But I am nervous about seeing my actual hotel room. Decor and astrology can be bad bedfellows. I once stayed in a luxury retreat in New Zealand that was marketed to Hollywood celebrities for its total privacy. Costing thousands a night, you could only access the property by boat or by chopper. It was stunning \u2013 until I got inside and realised with horror that the walls were covered in hectic 1970s Californian zodiac art; blue-silver dolphins leaping through the starry night sky, a topless maiden with Medusa hair perched improbably on the pointy tip of a crescent moon. I couldn\u2019t imagine any celebrities, apart from Jerry Garcia, wanting to stay there. Rooms are allocated at the astrology hotel based on star sign and, as Scorpio (mine) is known as the sexiest, most passionate star sign in the Zodiac, I brace myself for room decorated with pink, fur-lined handcuffs, a riding crop and edible undies. Instead my room is incredibly tasteful. It\u2019s like a room for someone who has no star-sign. The soft furnishings are in neutral colours and there are large windows looking out over to the University of Technology Sydney and Ultimo. The art on the walls is so inoffensive that I have no recollection of it as soon as I check out. The room is spacious and light and I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone regardless of their star sign or even if they think astrology is a load of rubbish \u2013 because it is actually very nice. Part of the service at the hotel is a personal reading with the hotel\u2019s resident astrologer, Damian. After we discuss that my reading may be inexact because of no one knowing when I was born, he asks: \u201cHow was your stay? What did you do?\u201d \u201cI got dumplings and did some work,\u201d I mumble, feeling like a loser. I\u2019m letting the sexy Scorpio rep down. Maybe I could pretend I had sex in the room. Instead, I say, \u201cPork and chive from Chinese Noodle House.\u201d I\u2019ve never had an astrology reading before. It feels closer to a therapy session than a prediction of future events (\u201cPeople often think you\u2019re irrational or illogical but you\u2019re not\u201d) until Damian says, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to like to hear this, but \u2026 \u201d If there\u2019s something that you don\u2019t want to hear in an astrology reading, it\u2019s the astrologer saying; \u201cYou\u2019re not going to like to hear this, but \u2026 \u201d But? But? But what? Do you know when I\u2019m going to die? Am I ill? What? What am I not going to like to hear? Damian takes a deep breath and says, \u201cYou are going to have another boring two or three years.\u201d \u201cAnother?\u201d According to my charts, the last two and a half years have been very dull. These are my beige, soft furnishing years. But in 2019 \u2013 watch out world, my sparkly fluoro dolphin will be leaping in the moonglow from starry seas. Do you want porridge with that? Its Sunday night and a friend is having a birthday dinner at a pizza restaurant in the central Victorian town of Malmsbury. \u201cOoh, Malmsbury,\u201d I say. \u201cRisque choice!

Three organisations have released new research showing that top-tier female managers earn, on average, $93,000 less per year than their male equivalents, they are twice as likely to be told they need more \u201cconfidence\u201d to be a leader (yet are more frequently criticised for being assertive) and, finally, that women who are culturally diverse \u2013 that is, not Anglo-Celtic\u2013 have it worst of all. Top-tier female managers earn, on average, 26.5% less than their male counterparts, according to a report by the Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre, in collaboration with the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. Nearly $40,000 of that difference comes from additional remuneration, including bonuses. Unsurprisingly, it appears that the organisations that have managed to do the best job of narrowing the pay gap also have a gender-balanced leadership, according to the Gender Equity Insights 2017: Inside Australia\u2019s Gender Pay Gap report, which looked at more than 12,000 private sector organisations (of more than 100 employees each). The pay gap at those companies (on average 10%) is half the size of those found in organisations where women were hardest to find in leadership roles. Tellingly, gender pay gaps in favour of men are also seen to rise sharply in organisations where the management ranks are heavily female-dominated (more than 80% women). This reflects the fact that these are traditionally \u201cfemale\u201d industries where men have tended to be at the uppermost levels: healthcare and social assistance, the retail sector and education and training. Associate prof Rebecca Cassells, author of the report and BCEC principal research fellow, says the findings are an indicator of the different ways women and men engage with the workforce and how their respective contributions are valued. \u201cNot only do female-dominated organisations tend to be lower paid but this analysis shows that, in workplaces with heavily female-dominated management teams, there are large gender pay gaps in favour of men,\u201d she says. \u201cIt seems that where the men are few, they are more highly valued.\u201d The inequality in pay begins right at the first job, with young graduate women earning 2.9% less on base salary and 2.1% less on total remuneration. The gap rises with seniority. And, while women are being paid less than their male counterparts, they are also getting conflicting messages about what it takes to get ahead. Research by Chief Executive Women and Bain &amp; Company finds a stark difference between the feedback received by men and women. \u201cWe found that women are twice as likely as men to receive feedback indicating they need to show \u2018more confidence\u2019 to be ready for promotion,\u201d say the authors of the Advancing Women in Australia: Eliminating Bias in Feedback and Promotions report. \u201cWomen in this situation also face a double bind in which they are often criticised for coming across as too assertive, as this goes against ingrained feminine stereotypical behaviours. \u201cExecutive female respondents had been told to \u2018toughen up\u2019, \u2018be more likeable at the expense of efficiency\u2019 and \u2018temper [their] enthusiasm\u2019.\u201d When it came to promotion to executive roles, nearly twice as many women as men were told they needed to change their style. Women reported being surprised at this turn of events and the report authors surmised that, when women\u2019s careers are approaching executive level, they start being seen as a \u201criskier\u201d appointment because they appear different to the incumbent men. Women also frequently received feedback that they needed \u201cmore experience\u201d to be ready for promotion. \u201cIn fact, in our survey, this was the most common feedback women received,\u201d say the authors. \u201cDecision-makers still need to see women perform at their current level for longer than their male counterparts and perform with more \u2018apparent\u2019 confidence before feeling comfortable appointing them.\u201d The feedback offered to the women and men was reported to be lacking in clarity but more so for women. \u201cSo, the bottom line is that women are being told to display \u2018more confidence\u2019 and to get \u2018more experience\u2019 but they are receiving less clear and actionable feedback than their male peers \u2013 likely a significant factor in the growing disparity in the promotion of men vs. women in senior ranks.\u201d Women account for 34% of senior managers and 16% of chief executives in the private sector. These figures get worse in large publicly listed companies, where only 5% of ASX 200 CEOs are women. The Diversity Council Australia and Deakin University, with the support of CPA Australia, has looked at the representation of culturally-diverse women in the leadership roles of all Australian listed companies between 2004 and 2015. While they found some improvement, it was from a very low base. All women\u2019s representation in ASX leadership is at an all-time high (8.2% of directors, 4.9% of senior executives and 4.2%of chief executives). Over that 11 years, the proportion of culturally diverse female leaders has doubled to 1.9% of senior executives, 2.5% of directors and one percent of CEOs. The percentage of female ASX leaders who are culturally diverse appears to have plateaued between 2013 and 2015 in all roles. The chief executive of the Diversity Council Australia, Lisa Annese, says the results show how much work there is still to do. \u201cIt would appear that culturally diverse women are experiencing a \u2018double jeopardy\u2019 in ASX leadership \u2013 where their gender and culture combine to make it more difficult than non-culturally diverse women, or even culturally diverse men, to access leadership roles,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are undoubtedly not making the most of the talent that we know is out there in the community.

Australia will have contributed around $100m by the time the summit begins, including $48m on the continuing presence of 73 Australian federal police officers, <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-01/australia-bankrolls-png-summit-costs/8228208\">according to the ABC</a>. Australia\u2019s justice minister, Michael Keenan, acknowledged the high level of support was in part to prevent China stepping in.</p> <p>Last month the PNG minister for sport, national events and Apec, Justin Tkatchenko, described the contribution of Australia, New Zealand and the US as \u201cbeyond that which would ordinarily be afforded to an Apec host\u201d.</p> <p>PNG\u2019s fiscal outlook was very different when it agreed to host the summit, Pryke said. Off the back of lower commodity prices and government revenues, as well as the El Ni\u00f1o drought, the country\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/pg/en/budget-commentary/assets/2017%20PwC%20Budget%20Commentary.pdf\">real GDP growth has fallen</a> from 11.8% in 2015 to a forecast 2.8% in 2017.</p> <p>\u201cBack when they committed to host Apec their commodity process were at an all-time high, and they were about to start producing from their largest ever project in the natural resources sector which was going to increase their GDP by a third,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThey expected to have overflowing government revenues, then they got hit at the worst possible time by global commodity prices. What they expected to be their heyday turned into quite the opposite.</p> <p>\u201cThey are committed to hosting Apec and rightly or wrongly it is going to go ahead, and unfortunately it\u2019s going to come at a significant cost to the taxpayers in that country.\u201d</p> <p>In June the country also goes to a national election. Pryke said the government\u2019s spending on Apec while it fails to keep the lights on in parliament is causing consternation among the Port Moresby middle class, but it\u2019s hard to know what affect it will have in the provinces. An estimated 85% of Papua New Guineans live in rural areas.</p> <p>\u201cPNG politics ultimately is very local,\u201d said Pryke.</p> <p>\u201cIt matters less for the rank and file voter \u2013 these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/24/australia-well-placed-sanctions-png-corruption\">national scandals</a> and challenges \u2026 Because we don\u2019t have a great network out to these rural communities it\u2019s really hard to make a prediction from outside PNG as to what going to happen.\u201d</p>",

It had paid back 7m kina ($2.86m) by late February. \u201cCustomers were issued with notices to come forward and pay up their bills for 2016 but those that have failed have forced PNG Power to carry out the disconnection exercise,\u201d the company said in February. \u201cWe are working closely with the chief secretary\u2019s office to come up with a repayment plan so that the government organisations can settle their outstanding bills.\u201d Again, Pryke said it isn\u2019t known if this was a sign of a cash-strapped government or just struggling bureaucracy. It comes as the government prepares to host next year\u2019s Apec summit, with a reported budget of about $330m. Australia will have contributed around $100m by the time the summit begins, including $48m on the continuing presence of 73 Australian federal police officers, according to the ABC. Australia\u2019s justice minister, Michael Keenan, acknowledged the high level of support was in part to prevent China stepping in. Last month the PNG minister for sport, national events and Apec, Justin Tkatchenko, described the contribution of Australia, New Zealand and the US as \u201cbeyond that which would ordinarily be afforded to an Apec host\u201d. PNG\u2019s fiscal outlook was very different when it agreed to host the summit, Pryke said. Off the back of lower commodity prices and government revenues, as well as the El Ni\u00f1o drought, the country\u2019s real GDP growth has fallen from 11.8% in 2015 to a forecast 2.8% in 2017. \u201cBack when they committed to host Apec their commodity process were at an all-time high, and they were about to start producing from their largest ever project in the natural resources sector which was going to increase their GDP by a third,\u201d he said. \u201cThey expected to have overflowing government revenues, then they got hit at the worst possible time by global commodity prices. What they expected to be their heyday turned into quite the opposite. \u201cThey are committed to hosting Apec and rightly or wrongly it is going to go ahead, and unfortunately it\u2019s going to come at a significant cost to the taxpayers in that country.\u201d In June the country also goes to a national election. Pryke said the government\u2019s spending on Apec while it fails to keep the lights on in parliament is causing consternation among the Port Moresby middle class, but it\u2019s hard to know what affect it will have in the provinces. An estimated 85% of Papua New Guineans live in rural areas. \u201cPNG politics ultimately is very local,\u201d said Pryke. \u201cIt matters less for the rank and file voter \u2013 these national scandals and challenges \u2026 Because we don\u2019t have a great network out to these rural communities it\u2019s really hard to make a prediction from outside PNG as to what going to happen.\u201d",

More than 1,000 new homes were built under the program but Indigenous communities said it failed to address overcrowding and, in many cases, built inappropriate dwellings. In Milikapiti, on the Tiwi Islands, residents on Wednesday were told the latest fix was on its way. The $200m Room to Breathe initiative, building additional living spaces on already existing dwellings, forms part of the $1.1bn, 10-year election commitment to remote housing. The short-term fixes, ranging in cost from $13,000 to $220,000, avoid the land tenure and civil works issues that come with building new houses, and it\u2019s hoped they will improve conditions, reduce overcrowding and provide local real employment. \u201cRJCP is lousy money, we need the young ones to have a better life and work for it,\u201d Mary Moreen, a traditional owner, told the NT chief minister, Michael Gunner.

Racist hate speech can damage an individual\u2019s self confidence and self-esteem leading to social attitudes of racial supremacism, prejudice and racial separatism. I do not want to see my fellow Australians of ethnic backgrounds experience such harsh treatment and judgment. </p> <p>For four long years, alongside many multicultural community leaders, I have advocated for the retention of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act (RDA). Like representatives of the Jewish, Muslim, Asian-Australian, European-Australian, African-Australian and Indigenous Australian communities, we were concerned the Abbott government would move to repeal 18C all together. After nearly a decade working with multicultural and interfaith Australians, I have never seen an issue that has brought all community leaders together under one banner. Community representatives have taken to the streets as well as appearing at parliamentary committee hearings with the purpose of protecting 18C as it stands.</p> <p>The anti-18C advocates have got it all wrong. Section 18C is not about freedom of speech, section 18D already provides protection of freedom of speech. Section 18C is about protecting Australians from all backgrounds from hate speech \u2013 and there is a big difference. </p> <p>For the past 40 years, the RDA has played an important role in protecting and maintaining Australia\u2019s cohesive, diverse and multicultural society. While Australia at the national level remains one of the very few liberal democracies to not have a national bill of rights, the RDA has effectively served in that capacity by ensuring all Australians, regardless of race and background, are treated fairly and equally.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/guide/article/2017/02/01/face-racism-what-you-need-know\">survey commissioned by SBS and Western Sydney University</a>, one in five Australians have experienced racism in the past 12 months. Nearly a third of those surveyed said they have experienced racism within their workplace and educational facility. At least 35% of respondents said they\u2019ve experienced racism on public transport and nearly half of Indigenous respondents said they have experienced racism in some shape or form at sporting events. </p> <p>It is unfortunate that so many people are still made to feel unwelcome in our diverse country. This is why calls to water down section 18C and the RDA would send the wrong message to potential offenders that discrimination, vilification and hate speech is accepted in our society.</p> <p>Results from the same survey indicate that up to 77% of Muslim women in Australia have experienced racism on public transport or in the street. To ensure Australians from interfaith backgrounds are given adequate legislative protection, I would like to see sections 18C and 18D strengthened by adding \u201creligion\u201d into the protection. </p> <p>Such protections already exist in state based legislation such as the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 in Victoria and the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 in New South Wales and it should also be included at the federal level. We live in a society that allows an individual to practice any religion they choose. Muslim Australians should be able to practice their faith without fear, judgment and vilification. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2016/nov/14/the-tirade-about-18c-is-a-massive-piece-of-fakery-a-culture-war-conceit\">The tirade about 18C is a massive piece of fakery, a culture war conceit | Richard Ackland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After a three-month public inquiry, the parliamentary joint committee on human rights handed down its report this week. The report recommended minimal changes to 18C but the biggest change of all is to the operation of the Australian Human Rights Commission and the complaints handling process, including the appointment of a judge to serve as a judicial member to deal with initial complaints \u2013 a suggestion that many of us in the multicultural and interfaith communities have asked for. </p> <p>Section 18C is not there to prohibit free speech, it is there to prevent hate speech. A majority of the anti-18C advocates do not understand how it feels to be judged on the basis of their skin colour or faith. They have never been put in a situation where their fellow citizens have made them feel unwelcome in their own country.</p> <p>The decision to prevent racist hate speech from gaining further prominence is in the hands of the prime minister. For the sake of Australia\u2019s multicultural, harmonious and inclusive society, we hope he will make the right decision and put an end to any further attempts to water down 18C.</p> <p><em>Jieh-Yung Lo is the co-founder of Poliversity and a member of the Australian-Chinese community.</em></p>",

According to a survey commissioned by SBS and Western Sydney University, one in five Australians have experienced racism in the past 12 months. Nearly a third of those surveyed said they have experienced racism within their workplace and educational facility. At least 35% of respondents said they\u2019ve experienced racism on public transport and nearly half of Indigenous respondents said they have experienced racism in some shape or form at sporting events. It is unfortunate that so many people are still made to feel unwelcome in our diverse country. This is why calls to water down section 18C and the RDA would send the wrong message to potential offenders that discrimination, vilification and hate speech is accepted in our society. Results from the same survey indicate that up to 77% of Muslim women in Australia have experienced racism on public transport or in the street. To ensure Australians from interfaith backgrounds are given adequate legislative protection, I would like to see sections 18C and 18D strengthened by adding \u201creligion\u201d into the protection. Such protections already exist in state based legislation such as the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 in Victoria and the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 in New South Wales and it should also be included at the federal level. We live in a society that allows an individual to practice any religion they choose. Muslim Australians should be able to practice their faith without fear, judgment and vilification. After a three-month public inquiry, the parliamentary joint committee on human rights handed down its report this week. The report recommended minimal changes to 18C but the biggest change of all is to the operation of the Australian Human Rights Commission and the complaints handling process, including the appointment of a judge to serve as a judicial member to deal with initial complaints \u2013 a suggestion that many of us in the multicultural and interfaith communities have asked for. Section 18C is not there to prohibit free speech, it is there to prevent hate speech. A majority of the anti-18C advocates do not understand how it feels to be judged on the basis of their skin colour or faith. They have never been put in a situation where their fellow citizens have made them feel unwelcome in their own country. The decision to prevent racist hate speech from gaining further prominence is in the hands of the prime minister. For the sake of Australia\u2019s multicultural, harmonious and inclusive society, we hope he will make the right decision and put an end to any further attempts to water down 18C.
