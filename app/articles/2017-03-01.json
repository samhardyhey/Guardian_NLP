The inquiry arose amid concerns among Coalition politicians that the act restricts free speech, particularly section 18C, which says it is unlawful for a person to do an act in public which is \u201creasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\u201d another person or a group of people. So, given all the discussion of the act by politicians, how frequent are racial discrimination complaints and how many of them result in court action? The Australian Human Rights Commission publishes detailed statistics on complaints it receives in its annual reports. The AHRC handles complaints under a number of acts, including the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act, the Age Discrimination Act and the Australian Human Rights Commission Act. Here are the number of complaints under each act for the past 10 years \u2013 this shows all complaints under the Racial Discrimination Act, not just those relating to section 18C: On average, there were about 418 racial discrimination complaints a year. Within those racial discrimination complaints, there were still fewer complaints that specifically related to section 18C, with only 77 in the last financial year: Of the complaints relating to section 18C, the majority concerned employment, with 25 out of 77 complaints in this area: The majority of all racial discrimination complaints were resolved in a conciliation process with the AHRC, with 70% of complaints in the 2015-16 financial year resolved in this way: Complaints were disproportionately made by people of Indigenous background, with 54% of complainants identifying as Indigenous in 2015-16. When complaints are not resolved by conciliation, complainants can take the complaint to court.

still lowering the take-home pay of existing workers by offering them less lucrative shifts.</p> <p>On Friday Guardian Australia reported that <a

noted the commission did not favour exempting current workers from cuts through \u201cred-circling\u201d or grandfathering but rather favours phasing in penalty rate cuts over several years.</p> <p>He

take-home pay orders or phasing cuts in over time \u2013 was a matter for FWC.</p> <p>On ABC AM Turnbull acknowledged that workers who work more public holidays or Sundays could still be worse off.</p> <p>Turnbull said it was \u201creckless\u201d for parliament to set penalty rates, and Bill Shorten was a hypocrite for opposing Greens proposals to block penalty rate cuts in 2016 but supporting them after the commission\u2019s decision.</p> <p>A spokesman for the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, told Guardian Australia the employment department would make a \u201cfactual submission\u201d to the commission, but would not weigh in to back grandfathering.</p> <p>On ABC\u2019s AM, the Labor deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, said that one-fifth of the Australian workforce changes jobs each year.</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not sure how long that would actually protect workers for, particularly in areas like retail, hospitality, the industries that are affected by this

      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull has poured cold water on a proposal to grandfather penalty rate cuts to protect the rates of existing workers but apply the cuts to new workers immediately. Turnbull has said the government supports the objective that workers\u2019 take-home pay should be protected but it was up to the Fair Work Commission to decide how to do that. On Thursday the former employment minister, Eric Abetz, called for Sunday penalty rate cuts in four industries to be grandfathered \u201censure that no worker is worse off while allowing new opportunities for the unemployed and especially for young unemployed people\u201d. Labor has rejected the proposal, arguing high turnover in the retail, hospitality, fast food and pharmacy industries will mean grandfathering is insufficient protection for workers. Grandfathering could also result in employers rostering new casual employees on Sunday shifts, helping them access the lower pay rates and still lowering the take-home pay of existing workers by offering them less lucrative shifts. On Friday Guardian Australia reported that the cuts of between 25 to 50% in Sunday rates could be grandfathered, instead of phased in over a number of years, as a means to protect current workers from cuts. On Thursday on ABC\u2019s AM, Malcolm Turnbull reiterated the government\u2019s support for the independent Fair Work Commission, but declined to comment on the substance of its decision. At a press conference Turnbull said the evidence was \u201cvery strong\u201d that it was more affordable for employers to take on new workers if penalty rates were lowered. On ABC AM Turnbull noted the commission did not favour exempting current workers from cuts through \u201cred-circling\u201d or grandfathering but rather favours phasing in penalty rate cuts over several years. He suggested that yearly increases in award base rates of pay could offset reductions in penalty rates to some extent. \u201cWe\u2019re supportive of the commission managing this in a way that ensures that take-home pay is \u2013 as far as possible \u2013 maintained, that is the objective of modern awards.\u201d At the press conference, Turnbull said that \u201chow the commission protects low-paid workers ... in this transition is a matter for the commission\u201d. He said the government supported the objective that workers\u2019 take-home pay is protected, but \u201chow that\u2019s done\u201d \u2013 whether through take-home pay orders or phasing cuts in over time \u2013 was a matter for FWC. On ABC AM Turnbull acknowledged that workers who work more public holidays or Sundays could still be worse off. Turnbull said it was \u201creckless\u201d for parliament to set penalty rates, and Bill Shorten was a hypocrite for opposing Greens proposals to block penalty rate cuts in 2016 but supporting them after the commission\u2019s decision. A spokesman for the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, told Guardian Australia the employment department would make a \u201cfactual submission\u201d to the commission, but would not weigh in to back grandfathering. On ABC\u2019s AM, the Labor deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, said that one-fifth of the Australian workforce changes jobs each year. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure how long that would actually protect workers for, particularly in areas like retail, hospitality, the industries that are affected by this award cut \u2013 you\u2019ve got quite a high turnover of staff. \u201cThat\u2019s not an adequate solution.\u201d Abetz was asked why employers wouldn\u2019t sack people to employ new workers at lower rates and he replied that adverse action provisions in the Fair Work Act make it unlawful to sack people based on their industrial conditions. Adverse action would also make it unlawful not to roster old employees on casual shifts to avoid paying higher rates, but the onus of proof for employers to avoid liability is very low. On Thursday the Australian reported that Pauline Hanson is considering backing away from her calls to abolish penalty rates. A One Nation spokesman reportedly said the party would \u201ctake a look\u201d at Labor\u2019s proposal to overturn the ruling and ban penalty rate cuts that reduce workers\u2019 take-home pay. The Greens have a similar proposal to freeze penalty rates at 2017 levels. One Nation\u2019s Brian Burston has already supported the FWC ruling. A spokesman for the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts said the party would \u201cconsider\u201d Labor\u2019s legislation \u201cwhen [the opposition] starts looking at reducing pollies\u2019 pay\u201d. New employment department figures have called into question union claims that 685,000 workers will be affected by the Sunday penalty rate cuts. According to the figures because not all workers work Sunday shifts, because only a quarter of the 1.14 million workers on the four affected awards work on Sundays, as few as 285,000 workers may receive a cut. However the employment department modelling did not factor in secondary effects such as employers seeking to pass on penalty rate cuts in enterprise agreements, or the possibility that more workers will be affected if enterprise agreements are terminated by the commission pushing workers back on to the award rate.",

      "bodyText": "On a cold winter\u2019s night in 1978, several hundred members of Sydney\u2019s LGBTI community walked down Oxford Street as part of a global movement against homophobia. They were met with police brutality and 53 arrests. Despite the backlash, including prayers for rain from Reverend Fred Nile, the Sydney Mardi Gras grew and grew. By the time I walked down the aisle of St Eanswythe\u2019s Anglican Church in the Melbourne suburb of Altona to marry the love of my life, eight years later, over 50,000 were marching in the colourful celebration of diversity at Mardi Gras. At that point, I knew of some of the challenges that LGBTI people faced. I\u2019d been to uni. Gay friends had died of Aids, I\u2019d had a crush on a girl. I\u2019d got to know and campaign with Bob Brown, who had been out as being gay since 1976. There was building public awareness of love being recognised for all that it is, and a growing recognition that gay and lesbian people are our friends and family, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters, mums and dads. But even though the shift towards equality was on, I never thought Mardi Gras would become such an important part of my life. How things change. A decade after our wedding, Penny shared her deepest secret with me. She identified as a woman and her desire to express her identity as a woman was not going away. As you can imagine, this revelation was not easy to deal with. But the commitment we made to each other at our wedding, before the law, before our friends and family, and before the church, was always going to prevail. We still loved each other. We had built a family, a home and our relationship, and nothing was going to change that. We celebrate our 31st wedding anniversary this week. Our partnership is stronger than ever, and we are proud of being one of the very few same-sex couples who have been legally married in Australia. It does not make sense that other couples are denied this right. One of the absurdities of our laws is that if Penny changed her gender on her birth certificate, we would be forced to divorce. My Greens colleagues at state level, including Jenny Leong in New South Wales and Sam Hibbins in Victoria, are working hard to reform this outdated law. But there is another way we can end this discrimination and allow thousands of other loving couples to show their commitment to each other before the law \u2013 to bring on marriage equality in federal parliament. It is fitting that creating equality is the theme for this year\u2019s Mardi Gras. Let\u2019s face it: Australia is lagging behind the rest of the world on this. But despite opponents doing their best to prolong the debate, we\u2019re getting closer and closer. The recent consensus report into the government\u2019s draft marriage equality law was an unprecedented show of collaboration and showed that we can work together to finally make this reform. The inquiry agreed that ministers of religion and religious organisations already have the ability to only solemnise marriages and use their premises consistent with their religious beliefs and so don\u2019t need further religious exemptions. We unanimously supported creating a new category of independent religious celebrants who would be able to solemnise marriages consistent with their faith. And we agreed that anti-discrimination laws should be reviewed to better balance freedom of and from religion. Of the red herring of cake bakers, florists and photographers who have religious conviction against equal marriage, any rights they claim have to be balanced with what is proportionate, and the harm being done to the people being discriminated against. The Greens believe that the balance would never necessitate the ability to discriminate. Many of us know LGBTI couples engaged and ready for marriage equality. If any caterers did not want to provide services, the reality would be that any of those couple\u2019s radiant smiles would melt any prejudice the caterers had. I\u2019m equally sure that there are many more cake bakers, florists and photographers who are hanging out for the extra business that marriage equality is going to bring. The Senate\u2019s consensus report now paves the way for politicians in parliament to have a free vote on marriage equality. It has been so disappointing to see a prime minister succumb to the extreme elements of his own party, but I truly believe that there are enough Coalition MPs who are willing to stand up for equality in their party room, and if required, cross the floor for this long-overdue achievement. Of everything that this Saturday\u2019s Mardi Gras will be, it will be first and foremost an expression of solidarity. We will come together to show that love is love, and that we can work together to achieve marriage equality. When Penny and I parade hand in hand with the Greens\u2019 marriage equality-themed float, we will thank those original marchers, now known as the 78ers, for paving the way for the possibility of equality. If Fred Nile\u2019s prayers are answered \u2013 as the forecast suggests it might \u2013 we will dance around in the rain. And we will look forward to a time when the sun starts shining and everyone in that crowd has the opportunity to marry the person they love.

      "bodyText": "Western Australian employment agencies are well below the national average in official quality measurements, with their Queensland counterparts also below par in most regions. A Guardian Australia analysis of the December quarter of JobActive star ratings reveals that job service providers in Western Australia and Queensland are the worst performing in the country. The performance and evaluation of employment agencies \u2013 which help jobseekers find work in 1,700 locations around Australia \u2013 will be scrutinised at Senate estimates on Thursday. Every quarter the federal employment department generates a one-to-five star rating for all providers and locations using criteria such as whether jobseekers are in work within 12 and 26 weeks. According to the analysis, JobActive providers in WA averaged just 1.36 stars, compared with 2.95 for Queensland and the national average of 3.11. In WA, the worst outcomes were in Geraldton, Broome and the great southern/wheatbelt region where providers received just one star on average. In Perth providers also averaged below two stars, with an average of 1.59 in Perth north and 1.39 in Perth south. In Queensland, results below the national average were recorded in Fitzroy (1.76), Wivenhoe (2.34), Mackay (2.6), Brisbane south-east (2.86), the Darling Downs (2.94), and Somerset (2.98). Star ratings are generated by comparing individual sites\u2019 employment outcomes to the national average. A one-star rating equates to scores 40% below the national average; a two-star rating means scores of between 15% and 39% below the national average. The ratings control for differences between labour markets and jobseekers by using regression analysis \u201cto allow for fair comparison of employment providers\u2019 performances across the country\u201d, the employment department says. Under this system, the department estimates expected outcome rates for each employment provider and then compares the actual outcomes to generate the star rating. Nationally 33% of sites are one or two stars and 67% are three, four or five stars. All other states and territories had scores above the national average: New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory (3.41), Victoria (3.13), South Australia (3.26), Tasmania (3.66) and the Northern Territory (3.45). In NSW, regions below the national average included: far west Orana (including Broken Hill) with 2.13, the central west (2.34) and Sydney north and west (2.70).

This means nearly all the sites in those regions fall below the department\u2019s own mark for requiring review.\u201d The chief executive of the National Employment Services Association, Sally Sinclair, told Guardian Australia the results were an \u201canomaly\u201d. \u201cIn 16 years I\u2019ve never seen a distribution like this,\u201d she said, in reference to WA and Queensland lagging so far behind the rest of the country.

The corridor outside my hotel room was very strongly fragranced with those reeds in bottles \u2013 I think they\u2019re called diffusers \u2013 and the smell was coming in through the crack around the door. I realised I was going to have a miserable night with a headache unless I could do something about it, so I went out and found a newsagent to buy a roll of packaging tape.

      "bodyText": "The Australian author Kate Grenville was on a book tour for her 2015 novel One Life when she started noticing the headaches. \u201cI was having them virtually every day,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom hotels I was staying in, taxis and planes I was riding in, and also from my readers \u2013 unfortunately. I love [them], but when they wear fragrance and want to give me a hug, it can be a problem.\u201d Grenville began looking into the reaction she was having and was startled to find how common it was. She will be speaking at Adelaide writers\u2019 week this month to discuss the book that came out of her experience: The Case Against Fragrance. If you\u2019re attending, she has one plea: don\u2019t douse yourself. Guardian Australia: The Case Against Fragrance is an investigation into perfumes partly inspired by your own experience. How bad has it become? Kate Grenville: The moment I\u2019d really realised I\u2019d gone beyond eccentric about all this was at a hotel in Launceston. The corridor outside my hotel room was very strongly fragranced with those reeds in bottles \u2013 I think they\u2019re called diffusers \u2013 and the smell was coming in through the crack around the door. I realised I was going to have a miserable night with a headache unless I could do something about it, so I went out and found a newsagent to buy a roll of packaging tape. When all the book business was done for the night, I taped all around the door to seal myself in like a pharaoh in a tomb. I thought: \u201cThis is crazy, I have entered some kind of planet crazy. Normal people don\u2019t do this, so what\u2019s wrong with me and am I the only one?\u201d What was the most surprising thing you came across in your investigation? The most startling thing in the beginning was that far from being the only one affected, one in three [Americans] report health problems that can be traced back to fragrance. Many people get headaches like I do, but other people know their asthma is triggered by it, [or have] other respiratory problems \u2013 like their throat closes up or they start coughing or sneezing \u2013 or they feel sick to the stomach when they smell fragrance. The next surprise was to find modern perfumes are mostly not made from flowers. Virtually all fragrances \u2013 whether very expensive in little tiny bottles, or the stuff you put in the toilet to make it smell nice \u2013 they are all made from chemicals. The surprise after that was that fragrance manufacturers don\u2019t have to declare all their ingredients, so on the one hand they can make stuff cheaply from synthetics, and on the other they don\u2019t have to tell us. The cocktail that makes up a fragrance is considered a \u201ctrade secret\u201d, and that\u2019s why they are exempt from the labelling laws. Have you noticed any difference on your current tour in the scent of your fans? Are they getting the message and toning it down for you? They are; it is fantastic. Last book tour I had a headache every single time I stood up in front of a group of people. This time it only happened once, probably from a cab I took to the venue. The publicist is putting on the bottom of all the invitations it would be appreciated if you could refrain from wearing perfume to this event. It has made such a difference to me, I\u2019m so grateful. Given that this has worked out so well for you, are there any issues you are encountering on this tour that might inspire the next book? I want to get back to writing a novel. This book was a departure for me, I\u2019ve never tried science writing, this was fuelled by my own interest in the subject. I made a decision to only to use published science, peer-reviewed \u2013 the internet is full of rubbish about fragrance and every other subject. I had to learn how to read proper science. I enjoyed it but I needed a lot of help, and the next book is going to be another novel. Any hints on what it might be about? Let me just say I am still just as fascinated about the early days of white settlement in Australia.

      "body": "<p>There were dramatic scenes in Monday morning\u2019s United States Bowling Congress Masters event in Las Vegas, won in awe-inspiring fashion by the Australian, Jason Belmonte. There were even more dramatic scenes in my living room, where tenpin bowling revealed itself as a telegenic contest brimming with sibling rivalry, psychological drama and sensible slacks. </p> <p>Then there was the bowling itself. If ESPN\u2019s commentators would rather be calling the Super Bowl or the NBA finals, they don\u2019t let on. \u201cAre you jacked up?\u201d screamed peroxide blonde anchor Dave Lamont at the start of proceedings, and the polite nod of his bowling hall of fame offsider Randy Pedersen mirrored my own.</p> <p>Later, in the opening stages of the final shoot-out, special comments man Pedersen explained that, \u201cthis is the kind of match where a single pin can hang you\u201d, which seemed a bit dramatic. But blow me down if the player he was describing \u2013 Californian college prodigy Michael Tang \u2013 didn\u2019t immediately buckle under the pressure and produce a spare, consigning himself to the gallows. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/23/the-box-seat-the-subtle-comforts-of-tv-sports-news-in-a-world-gone-mad\">The box seat: the subtle comforts of TV sports news in a world gone mad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most Australians wouldn\u2019t recognise him if his face had been tattooed on the backs of both hands, but with this triumph Belmonte clinched an unprecedented fourth Masters crown in five years, not to mention his eighth major title overall. Three more of those and this unsung hero will rank as bowling\u2019s greatest of all time, and a singular sporting force to rival Don Bradman, Margaret Court and Phar Lap. In Robert Ludlum parlance, we\u2019re now in the midst of The Belmonte Supremacy.</p> <p>Tenpin bowling people probably wouldn\u2019t put it in such overblown terms, though the highly unconventional Belmonte might. He is such a maverick talent he bowls with two hands guiding the ball, much as a child might. Indeed he learned his idiosyncratic technique as a toddler tearing around the bowling alley owned by his father in the country town of Orange. At the rate Belmonte wins tournaments, it\u2019s a wonder that more pros don\u2019t try it.</p> <p>Most but not all other bowlers (fans of Finland\u2019s Osku Palermaa and Swede Jesper Svensson are now sagely nodding) use one hand, at least at the sport\u2019s very top level on the PBA Tour, which is not intimidatingly removed from the highest-scoring lane of your own local alley. Still, any local wannabe who could beat Jason Belmonte would be doing alarmingly well. </p> <p>In Australia, tenpin bowling remains a quite obscure concern, hidden away on pay-TV. Its most notable flirtation with mainstream exposure \u2013 outside of its cult status in the fictional worlds of Kingpin and The Big Lebowski \u2013 occurred in the late 80s, but its hallowed position as the innings break palate cleanser during Nine\u2019s international cricket coverage was eventually surrendered to the 18-foot skiffs, then The Cricket Show. Dedicated sporting obscurists of a certain age will regale you with stories of Cara Honeychurch\u2019s 1998 Commonwealth games spree. If they can name a single prominent player since they\u2019re lying.</p> <p>It\u2019s a pity. As a TV spectacle tenpin bowling has much to recommend it, and for terminology alone it\u2019s a winner. Bowlers can be \u201cpower strokers\u201d and \u201ccrankers\u201d. Calling a spade a spade, the experts term Belmonte\u2019s delivery a \u201ctwo-handed shovel\u201d. If he is not inspiring legions of young impersonators it would be a missed opportunity for the sport.</p> <p>Those the Australian leapfrogged for this title ranged from the intense Utah native Alex Hoskins, who was a little too clenched on his television debut, and Sweden\u2019s fifth seed Martin Larsen, who was perhaps distracted by the presence of what appeared to be his entire extended family. Bottle blonde to a man and woman, they rather stood out among three rows of 40-something blokes with the almost identical combination of spiked hair, goatee beards and slightly unfashionable glasses. To rise up the Scandinavian fame ladder now, Larsen might need a bit-part in The Bridge.</p> <p>As per Australian law, Belmonte\u2019s nickname on the tour is \u201cBelmo\u201d. As per ESPN\u2019s considerable investment in the sport, this week he took home a winner\u2019s cheque of US$30,000, which is a lot of credits on the air hockey table. It is also why \u2013 as per the darts success of Simon \u2018The Wizard\u2019 Whitlock in the UK \u2013 he plies his trade in the US rather than slugging it away on the lacklustre Australian circuit, where rewards are more modest. You can\u2019t eat tenpin bowling trophies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/01/signs-point-to-intriguing-nrl-season-on-field-but-definitely-more-to-do-off-it\">Signs point to intriguing NRL season on field but definitely 'more to do' off it | Paul Connolly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The denouement here was compelling. Belmonte sealed it with seven consecutive strikes to blow past his flailing opponent in a 279-212 landslide. Tang did have his moments though. To get to the final he beat his higher-ranked older brother Darren in an act of fratricide to match Claudius\u2019s perfect game against Hamlet. Mr and Mrs Tang, who wore \u201cTeam Tang\u201d T-shirts, otherwise displayed no outward emotion. This is a sport which rewards level-headedness. Belmonte didn\u2019t allow himself fripperies like fist-pumps until the penultimate frame.</p> <p>Through it all, the closest the Australian came to bowling mortality was a spare on the eighth frame, and such is the standard to which he is held that Pedersen bluntly labelled one of the 33-year-old\u2019s less polished efforts \u201cfilthy\u201d.

      "bodyText": "There were dramatic scenes in Monday morning\u2019s United States Bowling Congress Masters event in Las Vegas, won in awe-inspiring fashion by the Australian, Jason Belmonte. There were even more dramatic scenes in my living room, where tenpin bowling revealed itself as a telegenic contest brimming with sibling rivalry, psychological drama and sensible slacks. Then there was the bowling itself. If ESPN\u2019s commentators would rather be calling the Super Bowl or the NBA finals, they don\u2019t let on. \u201cAre you jacked up?\u201d screamed peroxide blonde anchor Dave Lamont at the start of proceedings, and the polite nod of his bowling hall of fame offsider Randy Pedersen mirrored my own. Later, in the opening stages of the final shoot-out, special comments man Pedersen explained that, \u201cthis is the kind of match where a single pin can hang you\u201d, which seemed a bit dramatic. But blow me down if the player he was describing \u2013 Californian college prodigy Michael Tang \u2013 didn\u2019t immediately buckle under the pressure and produce a spare, consigning himself to the gallows. Most Australians wouldn\u2019t recognise him if his face had been tattooed on the backs of both hands, but with this triumph Belmonte clinched an unprecedented fourth Masters crown in five years, not to mention his eighth major title overall. Three more of those and this unsung hero will rank as bowling\u2019s greatest of all time, and a singular sporting force to rival Don Bradman, Margaret Court and Phar Lap. In Robert Ludlum parlance, we\u2019re now in the midst of The Belmonte Supremacy. Tenpin bowling people probably wouldn\u2019t put it in such overblown terms, though the highly unconventional Belmonte might. He is such a maverick talent he bowls with two hands guiding the ball, much as a child might. Indeed he learned his idiosyncratic technique as a toddler tearing around the bowling alley owned by his father in the country town of Orange. At the rate Belmonte wins tournaments, it\u2019s a wonder that more pros don\u2019t try it. Most but not all other bowlers (fans of Finland\u2019s Osku Palermaa and Swede Jesper Svensson are now sagely nodding) use one hand, at least at the sport\u2019s very top level on the PBA Tour, which is not intimidatingly removed from the highest-scoring lane of your own local alley. Still, any local wannabe who could beat Jason Belmonte would be doing alarmingly well. In Australia, tenpin bowling remains a quite obscure concern, hidden away on pay-TV. Its most notable flirtation with mainstream exposure \u2013 outside of its cult status in the fictional worlds of Kingpin and The Big Lebowski \u2013 occurred in the late 80s, but its hallowed position as the innings break palate cleanser during Nine\u2019s international cricket coverage was eventually surrendered to the 18-foot skiffs, then The Cricket Show. Dedicated sporting obscurists of a certain age will regale you with stories of Cara Honeychurch\u2019s 1998 Commonwealth games spree. If they can name a single prominent player since they\u2019re lying. It\u2019s a pity. As a TV spectacle tenpin bowling has much to recommend it, and for terminology alone it\u2019s a winner. Bowlers can be \u201cpower strokers\u201d and \u201ccrankers\u201d. Calling a spade a spade, the experts term Belmonte\u2019s delivery a \u201ctwo-handed shovel\u201d. If he is not inspiring legions of young impersonators it would be a missed opportunity for the sport. Those the Australian leapfrogged for this title ranged from the intense Utah native Alex Hoskins, who was a little too clenched on his television debut, and Sweden\u2019s fifth seed Martin Larsen, who was perhaps distracted by the presence of what appeared to be his entire extended family. Bottle blonde to a man and woman, they rather stood out among three rows of 40-something blokes with the almost identical combination of spiked hair, goatee beards and slightly unfashionable glasses. To rise up the Scandinavian fame ladder now, Larsen might need a bit-part in The Bridge. As per Australian law, Belmonte\u2019s nickname on the tour is \u201cBelmo\u201d. As per ESPN\u2019s considerable investment in the sport, this week he took home a winner\u2019s cheque of US$30,000, which is a lot of credits on the air hockey table. It is also why \u2013 as per the darts success of Simon \u2018The Wizard\u2019 Whitlock in the UK \u2013 he plies his trade in the US rather than slugging it away on the lacklustre Australian circuit, where rewards are more modest. You can\u2019t eat tenpin bowling trophies. The denouement here was compelling. Belmonte sealed it with seven consecutive strikes to blow past his flailing opponent in a 279-212 landslide. Tang did have his moments though. To get to the final he beat his higher-ranked older brother Darren in an act of fratricide to match Claudius\u2019s perfect game against Hamlet. Mr and Mrs Tang, who wore \u201cTeam Tang\u201d T-shirts, otherwise displayed no outward emotion. This is a sport which rewards level-headedness. Belmonte didn\u2019t allow himself fripperies like fist-pumps until the penultimate frame. Through it all, the closest the Australian came to bowling mortality was a spare on the eighth frame, and such is the standard to which he is held that Pedersen bluntly labelled one of the 33-year-old\u2019s less polished efforts \u201cfilthy\u201d. It was a strike, for the record. \u201cHe just got the full wrath of Jason Belmonte,\u201d concluded Lamont, excitable to the end. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t fly half the way around the world to finish second.\u201d But bowling was the winner. A note to Channel Nine: get it back on free-to-air TV while Australia\u2019s still got a world-beater. Elsewhere, there will be much excitement about tonight\u2019s NRL season opener between the Sharks and Broncos (Fox League, 8pm), because it\u2019ll be the first league action of 2017 not occurring outside a courthouse. You\u2019d assume differently if you\u2019d looked up at the TV screen of any Sydney pub in the last decade, but until Monday night the NRL did not have a dedicated Fox Sports channel to call home. That has now changed, with the new Fox League channel launching in the 502 slot previously occupied by Fox Sports 2, which moves to 503 and will presumably be called something else now, and likewise Fox Sports 3 to 505 (504 is occupied by Fox Footy). Fear not: the seemingly endless omnibus of Storage Wars repeats on A&amp;E remains unmolested. Fox League will also feature a new show called \u201cQueenslanders Only\u201d (Wednesdays, 8pm), which openly bills itself as \u201cparochial\u201d and features veteran journalist Robert Craddock interviewing the likes of Mal Meninga, Kevin Walters and Justin Hodges. I\u2019m smashing an empty can of XXXX over my forehead just thinking about it. In Saturday\u2019s cricket, Australia will be attempting to repeat their stupendous first Test victory against India with another in Bangalore (Fox Sports 1, 3pm). Commentating throughout will be Shane Warne, who last week claimed the nightmarish Pune pitch contained craters the size of Mars. A year on from earnestly suggesting humans had descended from extraterrestrials, the former leg-spinner\u2019s theories on interplanetary life are starting to rival those of the late jazz bandleader Sun Ra, who believed he\u2019d been sent from Saturn to spread peace on earth.

      "bodyText": "The progressive thinktank the Australia Institute has raised concerns about the operation of the Turnbull government\u2019s $5bn northern Australia infrastructure fund, saying the organisation lacks resources and is not being transparent about its internal procedures. With officials from the $5bn fund due to front Senate estimates hearings in Canberra on Thursday, the thinktank has released a report arguing the NAIF is behind other comparable government organisations in terms of process and disclosure, and in operational funding. The fund has been front-and-centre in national political debate, with the government flagging that it may invest in new infrastructure associated with the controversial Adani Group\u2019s $16.5bn coalmine, or in new coal-fired power generation. Last December the minister for resources and northern Australia, Matt Canavan, said the government had to \u201clook seriously\u201d at Adani\u2019s request for a loan to help build a $2.5bn railway to carry coal from the project to ports for export. He argued that building a common user railway would have wider benefits to the economy. In February Canavan also flagged subsidising a \u201cclean coal\u201d baseload power plant from the NAIF, and said the government had already heard from an interested party eyeing off economic development around the Adani project. Officials from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation told a Senate estimates hearing this week they had been approached last Friday by proponents of a new $1.2bn coal-fired power station with carbon capture and storage technology. But the outgoing CEFC chief executive, Oliver Yates, said he believed such a development was not financeable without the government agreeing to indemnify the project against the future risk of a carbon price being introduced and against the cost of delays in the project prompted by likely community protest action. The ABC subsequently revealed that the interested party was Clive Palmer\u2019s Waratah Coal company, which was intent on seeking government assistance to develop a \u201cclean coal\u201d plant in the Galilee basin. The NAIF now has four projects in due diligence but it is not clear what these projects are. The organisation is independent of the government, and officials in Canberra expect it to make recommendations to the government on specific investment projects over the course of this year. The Australia Institute made a number of requests under freedom of information laws seeking specific documentation about the fund\u2019s applications and approvals procedures, its credit policy guidelines, its risk appetite statement and its public benefit policy. The thinktank says inquiries for this material was knocked back on the basis that making the procedures transparent \u201cwould reveal to proponents and other interested parties the NAIF\u2019s methodologies beyond what is required or appropriate to disclose publicly\u201d. The NAIF refused to release certain documents because disclosure of the information \u201ccould provide certain parties with an advantage, and could cause proponents to alter their contact with the NAIF and possibly the content of their application, in a manner that makes it harder for the NAIF to objectively and accurately assess applications\u201d. The institute says the NAIF refused to say in response to the FoI requests whether or not it has any documents containing the key words \u201cAdani\u201d, \u201cGalilee basin\u201d or \u201cCarmichael\u201d. Tom Swann, the author of the report for the Australia Institute, said the NAIF\u2019s processes were opaque. \u201cKey policies are still missing and the publicly available guidance leaves much unclear,\u201d he said. \u201cHow will funds be prioritised? What scrutiny will be applied to the public interest requirement? How will negative impacts be considered? \u201cCompared to other comparable bodies, NAIF is behind in not only behind terms of process and disclosure, but it also its operational funding. It appears to be only a handful of staff.\u201d Swann said the government had put the organisation in a difficult position because it was attaching political urgency to projects and not backing the urgency up with appropriate resources.

And there were others. Good ones.</p> <p>Storm reached the decider four years in a row, 2006-09, winning (the match if not the gong) in \u201907 and \u201909. Then came the trouble in 2010 and they played a season for zero points. They were minor premiers in 2011 but knocked out in the preliminary final, before vindication, of sorts \u2013 winning legally in 2012.</p> <p>But back-to-back, even with all that illicit firepower, they could not go.</p> <p>Des Hasler\u2019s Sea Eagles made the decider three years straight (\u201995-\u201997) in the middle of the fractious and not very super Super League years for one premiership.</p> <p>Ricky Stuart\u2019s Roosters held aloft one very heavy trophy bearing the likeness of Norm Provan hugging Arthur Summons in the middle of their club\u2019s mini-dynasty between 2001-03. And didn\u2019t they have some players: Brad Fittler, Craig Fitzgibbon, Craig Wing, Anthony Minichiello, Adrian Morley, Bryan Fletcher and you\u2019d be leaving out a few including Brett Mullins who was on the wing.</p> <p>But back-to-back? No. And so to season 2017 and recent history tells us that the Sharks will not win the 2017 premiership. Let us count the ways.</p> <p>The great mini-dynasties \u2013 Brisbane (\u201892-\u201993), Roosters (\u201901-\u201903), Manly (\u201995-\u201997) \u2013 all kept their best players. The greater nucleus of their squad, their spines, their star-power, hung around.<br /></p> <p>The Brisbane teams that contested the \u201992 and \u201993 grand finals were identical bar one spot on the bench: Peter Ryan the first year, Tony Currie the next. And that\u2019s it. The backline was identical. The forward pack swapped Mark Hohn and Gavin Allen starting and bench. Bennett calmly oversaw it all.<br /></p> <p>As for the longer dynasties, their success begat success. Players came to them. It was dodgy how they could fit them in but Storm in \u201906-\u201912 (and arguably going still) and the Canberra Raiders of \u201987-\u201994 not only kept their best players, they added very good ones. </p> <p>The Raiders of \u201994 had added David Furner, John Lomax, Quentin Pongia, Mullins and Ken Nagas to the nucleus of champions Mal Meninga, Brad Clyde, Ricky Stuart and Laurie Daley.</p> <p>And that mob did go back-to-back in \u201989 and \u201990, and made four grand finals, and the finals every year until Super League came along. But <em>that</em> was a dynasty.</p> <p>Cronulla, meanwhile, have lost players. Two of their best: fullback <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/02/ben-barba-joins-world-rugbys-top-earners-after-taking-up-toulon-offer\">Ben Barba is off to France</a> and hooker and middle-man manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/26/cronulla-veteran-michael-ennis-nrl-retirement\">Mick Ennis is off to the media</a>. In their place are workhorse Panthers big man Jeremy Latimore and crazy-horse Bulldogs enigma Tony Williams, fine footy players for sure \u2013 but spinal cord members they are not.</p> <p>In 2016 the Sharks welcomed James Maloney and Chad Townsend, their six and seven. The year before it was Ennis, Barba and the super utility Jack Bird. They built better. This year, not so much. </p> <p>The Roosters went into 2014 with many pundits predicting \u2013 from a look at their roster, which is effectively the only data set one can hold a looking glass upon \u2013 they had the best chance of going back-to-back since those Broncos of the previous millennia. </p> <p>They had lost only the often-penalised meat axe Luke O\u2019Donnell and the bench forward Martin Kennedy. They added Remi Casty (from Catalans), Jackson Hastings (Dragons) and Heath L\u2019Estrange (Bradford). Contracts were signed by Anthony Minichiello, Mitchell Pearce, Daniel Tupou, Mitch Aubusson, Daniel Mortimer, Frank-Paul Nuuausala and a certain Sonny Bill Williams.</p> <p>And they hummed on into 2014 and finished minor premiers. They lost their qualifying final by a point to Penrith Panthers, then won their semi-final against North Queensland 31-30 after leading 30-nil before half-time. A 76th minute Maloney field goal stayed the execution that would follow next week when they faced Souths who had run third, beaten Manly and had a break.<br /></p> <p>And there died Rooster dreams. In late 2015 they punted Maloney to the premiers, Sonny Bill took off and they\u2019ve been middling ever since.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/28/geoff-toovey-its-very-easy-to-pull-club-culture-apart\">Geoff Toovey: 'It\u2019s very easy to pull club culture apart'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>North Queensland Cowboys entered 2016 with, just like the Roosters before them, strongly tipped to emulate the Broncos. They had lost only the workhorse forward Glenn Hall. Yet they hadn\u2019t grown and they didn\u2019t add strength. Shaun Hudson came from Gold Coast Titans and Jahrome Hughes from Townsville Blackhawks. Hudson didn\u2019t get on the park. Hughes played one game and signed for Storm in June.</p> <p>Six of their players were bashed around in State of Origin, including their seemingly bash-proof champion Johnathan Thurston. They still finished fourth, a points-differential decision over their fellow grand finalists Brisbane Broncos who also had six Origin-battered players.<br /></p> <p>In the first final the Cows were beaten up by Melboune Storm at AAMI Park. The next one they tipped out the Broncos 26-20 in Townsville. And in week three they limped on down to Sydney and were rissoled by the premiers.</p> <p>Souths\u2019 defence of their title in 2015 began by losing Sam Burgess to Bath and Ben Te\u2019o to Leinster. Souths finished seventh. And that\u2019s all they\u2019d probably like to remember about that. They did win the Auckland Nines, though.</p> <p>And here we are. The Sharks defending the indefensible.</p> <p>Or is it? They do have James Maloney still, and he\u2019s a fun running gun. Valentine Holmes always wanted to play fullback and now gets his chance. Jack Bird will improve again. And to the meat of their forward pack comes Jeremy Latimore and Tony Williams.</p> <p>But Paul Gallen and Luke Lewis are blown calf from limping 26 rounds. And they\u2019ll be hard marked and studied by all the other clubs. And history is against them. And they haven\u2019t built on their success. Had they hung onto Ennis and Barba, you could say they were par, another top four chance and from there who knows.</p> <p>But these Sharks? History tell us it\u2019s going to be difficult to go back-to-back.</p>",

And they did need to be lucky enough to (again) front a Dragons side whose firepower featured stick-legged wing Ian \u201cChook\u201d Herron and Graeme \u201cThe Penguin\u201d Bradley whose sole job in the centres was to test Renouf\u2019s dodgy jaw. Which he failed to accomplish. Since then we\u2019ve had a few what could be called \u201cmini-dynasties\u201d without a team going back-to-back. Melbourne Storm have been closest, albeit with a club roster that needed two sets of books to fit in Greg Inglis, Israel Folau, Cooper Cronk, Cameron Smith, Billy Slater, Ryan Hoffman, Adam Blair, Matt King, Michael Crocker, Jeff Lima, Jeremy Smith and Matt Geyer. And there were others. Good ones. Storm reached the decider four years in a row, 2006-09, winning (the match if not the gong) in \u201907 and \u201909. Then came the trouble in 2010 and they played a season for zero points. They were minor premiers in 2011 but knocked out in the preliminary final, before vindication, of sorts \u2013 winning legally in 2012. But back-to-back, even with all that illicit firepower, they could not go. Des Hasler\u2019s Sea Eagles made the decider three years straight (\u201995-\u201997) in the middle of the fractious and not very super Super League years for one premiership. Ricky Stuart\u2019s Roosters held aloft one very heavy trophy bearing the likeness of Norm Provan hugging Arthur Summons in the middle of their club\u2019s mini-dynasty between 2001-03. And didn\u2019t they have some players: Brad Fittler, Craig Fitzgibbon, Craig Wing, Anthony Minichiello, Adrian Morley, Bryan Fletcher and you\u2019d be leaving out a few including Brett Mullins who was on the wing. But back-to-back? No. And so to season 2017 and recent history tells us that the Sharks will not win the 2017 premiership. Let us count the ways. The great mini-dynasties \u2013 Brisbane (\u201892-\u201993), Roosters (\u201901-\u201903), Manly (\u201995-\u201997) \u2013 all kept their best players. The greater nucleus of their squad, their spines, their star-power, hung around. The Brisbane teams that contested the \u201992 and \u201993 grand finals were identical bar one spot on the bench: Peter Ryan the first year, Tony Currie the next. And that\u2019s it. The backline was identical. The forward pack swapped Mark Hohn and Gavin Allen starting and bench. Bennett calmly oversaw it all. As for the longer dynasties, their success begat success. Players came to them. It was dodgy how they could fit them in but Storm in \u201906-\u201912 (and arguably going still) and the Canberra Raiders of \u201987-\u201994 not only kept their best players, they added very good ones. The Raiders of \u201994 had added David Furner, John Lomax, Quentin Pongia, Mullins and Ken Nagas to the nucleus of champions Mal Meninga, Brad Clyde, Ricky Stuart and Laurie Daley. And that mob did go back-to-back in \u201989 and \u201990, and made four grand finals, and the finals every year until Super League came along. But that was a dynasty. Cronulla, meanwhile, have lost players. Two of their best: fullback Ben Barba is off to France and hooker and middle-man manager Mick Ennis is off to the media. In their place are workhorse Panthers big man Jeremy Latimore and crazy-horse Bulldogs enigma Tony Williams, fine footy players for sure \u2013 but spinal cord members they are not. In 2016 the Sharks welcomed James Maloney and Chad Townsend, their six and seven. The year before it was Ennis, Barba and the super utility Jack Bird. They built better. This year, not so much. The Roosters went into 2014 with many pundits predicting \u2013 from a look at their roster, which is effectively the only data set one can hold a looking glass upon \u2013 they had the best chance of going back-to-back since those Broncos of the previous millennia. They had lost only the often-penalised meat axe Luke O\u2019Donnell and the bench forward Martin Kennedy. They added Remi Casty (from Catalans), Jackson Hastings (Dragons) and Heath L\u2019Estrange (Bradford). Contracts were signed by Anthony Minichiello, Mitchell Pearce, Daniel Tupou, Mitch Aubusson, Daniel Mortimer, Frank-Paul Nuuausala and a certain Sonny Bill Williams. And they hummed on into 2014 and finished minor premiers. They lost their qualifying final by a point to Penrith Panthers, then won their semi-final against North Queensland 31-30 after leading 30-nil before half-time. A 76th minute Maloney field goal stayed the execution that would follow next week when they faced Souths who had run third, beaten Manly and had a break. And there died Rooster dreams. In late 2015 they punted Maloney to the premiers, Sonny Bill took off and they\u2019ve been middling ever since. North Queensland Cowboys entered 2016 with, just like the Roosters before them, strongly tipped to emulate the Broncos. They had lost only the workhorse forward Glenn Hall. Yet they hadn\u2019t grown and they didn\u2019t add strength. Shaun Hudson came from Gold Coast Titans and Jahrome Hughes from Townsville Blackhawks. Hudson didn\u2019t get on the park. Hughes played one game and signed for Storm in June. Six of their players were bashed around in State of Origin, including their seemingly bash-proof champion Johnathan Thurston. They still finished fourth, a points-differential decision over their fellow grand finalists Brisbane Broncos who also had six Origin-battered players. In the first final the Cows were beaten up by Melboune Storm at AAMI Park. The next one they tipped out the Broncos 26-20 in Townsville. And in week three they limped on down to Sydney and were rissoled by the premiers. Souths\u2019 defence of their title in 2015 began by losing Sam Burgess to Bath and Ben Te\u2019o to Leinster. Souths finished seventh. And that\u2019s all they\u2019d probably like to remember about that. They did win the Auckland Nines, though. And here we are. The Sharks defending the indefensible. Or is it? They do have James Maloney still, and he\u2019s a fun running gun. Valentine Holmes always wanted to play fullback and now gets his chance. Jack Bird will improve again. And to the meat of their forward pack comes Jeremy Latimore and Tony Williams. But Paul Gallen and Luke Lewis are blown calf from limping 26 rounds. And they\u2019ll be hard marked and studied by all the other clubs. And history is against them. And they haven\u2019t built on their success. Had they hung onto Ennis and Barba, you could say they were par, another top four chance and from there who knows. But these Sharks? History tell us it\u2019s going to be difficult to go back-to-back.",

The joint parliamentary committee on electoral matters has been given the task of recommending changes to to the donations and disclosure regime, and was expected to produce a report on foreign donations on Friday. But the special minister of state, Scott Ryan, confirmed late on Wednesday the committee had sought an extension of time to complete its work. The committee will now report on 10 March. There has been an effort in recent weeks to see if there can be convergence on the question of foreign donations, including applying a ban to campaign and activist groups like GetUp, as well as to political parties. Bruised by coordinated campaigns from progressive activist groups against the Coalition in marginal seats during the 2016 election, campaigns that supplemented a massive field operation from the ALP and trade unions \u2013 the government has signalled on several occasions it won\u2019t countenance reform of the donations and disclosure regime that applies only to political parties. The government has said it wants activist groups in the mix, given they also campaign during elections. Labor has signalled it is prepared to support a change that would see a foreign donations ban applied to activist groups as well as political parties, but only if the ban begins and ends with foreign sourced finance, and does not extend to curbs on activism during election campaigns. The Liberal party\u2019s federal director, Tony Nutt, used a recent appearance before the committee to address Labor\u2019s concerns about curbing activism directly. Nutt noted that activist groups and unions were \u201clegitimate contributors\u201d to political debates and he stressed the desirability of cross-party cooperation on electoral reform. Political sources taking a close interest in the outcome of the committee\u2019s deliberations think Nutt\u2019s comments were an effort to walk back a more strident statement by Malcolm Turnbull in February, when he said \u201cAustralians expect us to ensure that only Australians and Australian businesses can seek to influence Australian elections\u201d. Labor\u2019s assistant national secretary, Paul Erickson, has told the committee Labor accepts the principle of a level playing field between political and non-political actors in a democratic process \u2013 but he also noted that political parties, associated entities and other bodies running campaigns had different rights and responsibilities. One senior Labor figure put the issue this way: \u201cIt depends what the Liberals are looking at. Banning donations is one thing, but banning electioneering is something else \u2013 and how do you define electioneering? Is campaigning against the Adani coalmine electioneering or is it activism?\u201d If the major parties can\u2019t come to terms, and the government wants to pursue its own agenda on donations and the regulation of activist groups, it would have the option of trying to introduce reforms with the support of the Senate crossbench.",

While there was little expectation that the figures would be bad, had the economy gone backwards in the quarter we would have been in a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d (that most silly of phrases) given the September quarter<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/07/australian-economy-shrinks-by-05-in-september-quarter\"> saw the economy shrink 0.5%</a>.</p> <p>The December quarterly growth of 1.1% in seasonally adjusted terms was well above expectations and enabled the treasurer to talk of how \u201cAustralia is growing faster than every G7 economy\u201d.</p> <p>And certainly 1.1% quarterly growth is very strong. But before we turn up the music and start dancing in wild celebration, we should have a closer look, and a deep breath.</p> <p>Firstly, a big reason for the strong growth is because the figure is a comparison with the September quarter: December looks good purely because September was so bad.</p> <p>It is why the trend and seasonally adjusted figures tell rather different stories. In trend terms, the economy grew just 0.3% in the December quarter:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"g1\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ngnfM/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>And in the annual figures \u2013 which enable us to do more than just compare one bad quarter with one good one \u2013 we see the picture is pretty uninspiring.</p> <p>In seasonally adjusted terms, the economy grew by 2.4% in 2016, well below the long-term average and in trend terms it grew by just 1.9%, which is actually the worst annual growth since during the GFC:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"g2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/szkgK/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>Thus the story the treasurer is able to tell is due quite a bit to the convention that we report the seasonally adjusted figure as the big number rather than the trend figure.<br /></p> <p>And the seasonally adjusted figures can be a bit weird at times and not completely reflective of the true state of the economy.</p> <p>In the December quarter the big contributions to growth were household consumption, exports and public investment:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"g3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jPti8/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>The public investment was due to spending on the second NBN satellite as well as defence aircraft procurements. The growth of exports is not unexpected, but again shows the erratic nature of seasonally adjusted figures, given the past two quarters saw net exports detract from growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"g4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/suTfT/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>The growth in household spending is a bit odd given that in the December quarter the big driver was on more luxury type items, such as household furnishings and recreation and culture:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"g5\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OuHXm/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>The annual figures however are more understandable \u2013 rent, insurance and health being the big drivers of household spending. And while consumption remains a key component of our economic growth it remains well down on the levels the occurred prior to the GFC:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"g6\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HsPp0/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>A closer look at the national accounts explains why, because the real story of the GDP figures is how nominal growth has taken off and how wages have not. Nominal GDP grew by a whopping 3% in the December quarter alone \u2013 the strongest increase in one quarter since June 2010. The annual growth of 6.1% in seasonally adjusted terms and 5.2% in trend terms is the best for over 5 years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"g7\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pibny/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>The strong nominal GDP growth would bring a big smile to the treasurer given nominal GDP is a better guide for tax revenue than is real GDP \u2013 because taxes are paid in current dollars, not dollars minus inflation.</p> <p>The big driver of the nominal growth was increases in our export prices such as for iron ore and coal. The terms of trade in the December quarter grew by 9.1% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 the third biggest quarterly jump in the past 40 years. Even the trend growth of 6% is historically huge:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"g8\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/c96w1/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>But workers are not feeling the benefits. Because the growth is driven by export prices rather than through domestic demand, a great disconnect has occurred.</p> <p>While nominal GDP growth grew by the strongest level for seven years, wages and salaries actually went down 0.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis \u2013 the biggest quarterly fall since 1993. Even the trend growth of 0.2% is the lowest recorded outside of the GFC and the 1990s recession.</p> <p>That is not meant to happen.

      "bodyText": "The latest GDP figures are a prime example of the great divergence of major economic indicators and the reality that most people feel after strong economic growth in the December quarter last year failed to translate into growth for workers\u2019 wages. The treasurer, Scott Morrison would have breathed a small sigh of relief when the figures were released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday. While there was little expectation that the figures would be bad, had the economy gone backwards in the quarter we would have been in a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d (that most silly of phrases) given the September quarter saw the economy shrink 0.5%. The December quarterly growth of 1.1% in seasonally adjusted terms was well above expectations and enabled the treasurer to talk of how \u201cAustralia is growing faster than every G7 economy\u201d. And certainly 1.1% quarterly growth is very strong. But before we turn up the music and start dancing in wild celebration, we should have a closer look, and a deep breath. Firstly, a big reason for the strong growth is because the figure is a comparison with the September quarter: December looks good purely because September was so bad. It is why the trend and seasonally adjusted figures tell rather different stories. In trend terms, the economy grew just 0.3% in the December quarter: And in the annual figures \u2013 which enable us to do more than just compare one bad quarter with one good one \u2013 we see the picture is pretty uninspiring. In seasonally adjusted terms, the economy grew by 2.4% in 2016, well below the long-term average and in trend terms it grew by just 1.9%, which is actually the worst annual growth since during the GFC: Thus the story the treasurer is able to tell is due quite a bit to the convention that we report the seasonally adjusted figure as the big number rather than the trend figure. And the seasonally adjusted figures can be a bit weird at times and not completely reflective of the true state of the economy. In the December quarter the big contributions to growth were household consumption, exports and public investment: The public investment was due to spending on the second NBN satellite as well as defence aircraft procurements. The growth of exports is not unexpected, but again shows the erratic nature of seasonally adjusted figures, given the past two quarters saw net exports detract from growth: The growth in household spending is a bit odd given that in the December quarter the big driver was on more luxury type items, such as household furnishings and recreation and culture: The annual figures however are more understandable \u2013 rent, insurance and health being the big drivers of household spending. And while consumption remains a key component of our economic growth it remains well down on the levels the occurred prior to the GFC: A closer look at the national accounts explains why, because the real story of the GDP figures is how nominal growth has taken off and how wages have not. Nominal GDP grew by a whopping 3% in the December quarter alone \u2013 the strongest increase in one quarter since June 2010. The annual growth of 6.1% in seasonally adjusted terms and 5.2% in trend terms is the best for over 5 years: The strong nominal GDP growth would bring a big smile to the treasurer given nominal GDP is a better guide for tax revenue than is real GDP \u2013 because taxes are paid in current dollars, not dollars minus inflation. The big driver of the nominal growth was increases in our export prices such as for iron ore and coal. The terms of trade in the December quarter grew by 9.1% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 the third biggest quarterly jump in the past 40 years. Even the trend growth of 6% is historically huge: But workers are not feeling the benefits. Because the growth is driven by export prices rather than through domestic demand, a great disconnect has occurred. While nominal GDP growth grew by the strongest level for seven years, wages and salaries actually went down 0.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis \u2013 the biggest quarterly fall since 1993. Even the trend growth of 0.2% is the lowest recorded outside of the GFC and the 1990s recession. That is not meant to happen. Usually when nominal GDP grows, so too do wages and salaries \u2013 but not at the moment: Over the past 30 years the relationship between nominal GDP and earnings has been very strong. On average when nominal GDP has grown over a year by 5.2%, then wages and salaries should grow by around 5% rather than the current rate of 1.8%: It\u2019s indicative of the truly woeful wages growth we are currently experiencing \u2013 a growth that is out of whack with the state of the economy. There is for example usually a strong connection as well between the unemployment rate and wages growth (known as the Phillips curve). Generally as the unemployment rate falls, the growth of wages rises because there is more demand for workers and so employers have to pay more to keep workers and attract new ones. But right now the relationship has utterly broken down. Over the past 20 years, an unemployment rate of 5.7% that we currently have would be associated with wages growing by around 3.4%; instead wages (as defined by the wages price index) are growing by a record low of just 1.9%: There is bugger all reason for business groups to be complaining about industrial relations at the moment \u2013 especially in light of the penalty rates decision. In historical terms workers are the ones who are missing out. This is highlighted as well by the labour cost figures in the national accounts. Real unit labour costs in 2016 fell by 4.2% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 the biggest annual fall ever recorded. In real terms, the cost of labour is now lower than it ever has been: The big number in the GDP figures might suggest things are improving, but what the numbers really highlight is that things are not as strong as the erratic quarterly growth figure would suggest, and that workers are more than ever before missing out on the benefits of the growth that does exist.",

By the way, the relationship with UNE is so good that they are camping in McDonald\u2019s. <strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong> said they would be located in UNE, but they are in McDonald\u2019s. The APVMA does no research as such. They analyse data provided to them by the big multinational companies. So, he doesn\u2019t understand what it does. On that basis, I don\u2019t think he fully comprehended the consequence of gutting the APVMA, an organisation that has lost half of its staff. In some areas of expertise, 50% of the people have walked out of the building. Now he is going to have some sort of cyberspace experiment where people will be working from their homes here in Canberra. Well that\u2019s hardly going to bolster the economy of Armidale.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fitzgibbon says decentralisation rarely works though he accepts that \u201cmoving the APVMA to Armidale can do no harm to Armidale\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Decentralisation has rarely worked. Where it has worked, it\u2019s worked at the state level best. Where it has worked it has been successful because people have spent a long time developing a strategic plan and a transition. Barnaby Joyce has no strategic plan for the APVMA. It was a thought bubble. A thought bubble to shore him up in Armidale where <strong>Tony Windsor</strong> constantly defeats him at the ballot box. This is not a plan for decentralisation, this is a plan to get Barnaby Joyce re-elected.</p> </blockquote> <p>While the APVMA move may have been a plan to get re-elected by Joyce, Fitzgibbon cannot assert Windsor beat Joyce at the one and only election they fought.

The trend growth figure is a rather less ebullient 0.3%, and the trend annual growth figure is a fairly pathetic 1.9%.</p> <p><strong>The big driver of growth was household consumption</strong> \u2013 which contributed nearly half of the 1.1% growth \u2013 exports and also non-dwelling construction.</p> <p><strong> There is good news for the government from the nominal growth figures</strong>. Nominal GDP measure the size of the economy in current dollars and this figure has more of an impact for government tax revenue. In the December quarter nominal growth grew by 3.0% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 <strong>the best result since June 2010.</strong> It means nominal GDP grew by 6.1% in 2016.

(He had tried earlier in the day but <strong>chair Ian Macdonald</strong> put him off.)</p> <p>He was required to make the statement because, in November, he told the Senate that the first \u201cpersonal involvement\u201d he could recall in the matter was \u201con 3 March [2016], although my office had been dealing with the matter prior to that time\u201d.<br /></p> <p>But on Thursday <strong>Andrew Probyn</strong> of <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-23/claim-brandis-involved-in-bell-group-matter-earlier-than-he-says/8297792\">ABC\u2019s 7.30 reported that Brandis spoke</a> to the Western Australian attorney general, <strong>Michael Mischin</strong><strong>,</strong> about Bell on 1 February 2016, although Brandis said he had no recollection of it.<br /></p> <p>In a joint letter demanding Brandis explain the inconsistency, signed by <strong>Penny Wong</strong>, <strong>Richard Di Natale</strong>, <strong>Derryn Hinch</strong> and <strong>Nick Xenophon</strong>, the group warned the Senate treats misleading statements \u201cvery seriously\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Last night, Brandis repeatedly told the committee he could not recall the exchange and it would really mislead the Senate if he said he could recall.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the time I made my November 28 statement, I had no recollection of the exchange to which Mr Mischin refers. I still have no recollection of it. Were I to say that I recall such an exchange, I would be misleading the Senate, because I do not.</p> </blockquote> <p>I will have more on this throughout the morning.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/01/wayne-swan-labor-must-consider-buffett-rule-as-part-of-inequality-agenda\">Katharine Murphy reports</a> that the former treasurer <strong>Wayne Swan</strong> is going to come out in support of the Buffett rule, where high earners pay a minimum tax rate. The idea is opposed by the current shadow treasurer, <strong>Chris Bowen</strong>, so that will make for some lively caucus debate. Swan says working people voted for <strong>Donald Trump</strong> \u201cnot out of any hard-right ideology or an entrenched racial intolerance but because they no longer saw the Democrats as the party who spoke or acted for them\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consider if you\u2019re a truck driver in Logan or a steel worker in Wollongong, you\u2019re constantly told to work harder for less while tax cuts go to the top end \u2013 you might suck that up for a while because you have to,\u201d Swan will say.</p> <p>\u201cAll the while you see progressive social issues dominate the news. Eventually you reach a breaking point and your job is sent offshore or made casual.</p> <p>\u201cSuddenly you\u2019re tossed on the economic scrapheap and, like a drum of kerosene dumped directly on the smouldering fire, your frustration with progressive issues erupts in an inferno of white-hot rage.</p> <p>\u201cAnd quite a lot of that rage might express itself with immigration, gender equity or other favoured progressive issues \u2013 not because rage by definition doesn\u2019t contain itself very well but very much because the right will always supply scapegoats of various types. Anything to ensure the blame isn\u2019t sheeted home where it really belongs: the policies they designed to fleece working people and redistribute the gains to the top.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>George Christensen</strong> is feeling the anger. <a href=\"http://Like most of his colleagues from Queensland, Mr Christensen believed the merger in 2008 was a grave error but he thought it would be impractical to try to demerge.  &quot;There is a growing view among MPs and others that there should not be a demerger but a debranding,&quot; he said.

That is, if a government MP has a small business and benefits from the penalty rate cut, it is a conflict of interest according to Labor. While the point is arguable IMO given the penalty cut was a Fair Work Commission decision, Malcolm Turnbull did not answer the question. He preferred to point out previous deals negotiated by Bill Shorten at head of the Australian Workers\u2019 Union which remove penalty rates in enterprise bargaining agreements. Labor has also sought to target various government backbenchers for veiled or open support for the penalty rate cut. Ann Sudmalis was one, who described the cut as a \u201cgift\u201d which would create more jobs. After two days of question time targeting, she appeared a bit teary. The national account figures came out and behold, they were good. At least, not bad, certainly a big improvement on the last lot. Australia escaped falling into a technical recession. Barnaby Joyce went the full National party press conference to talk about his plan for decentralisation in a bold move to head off laughter over estimates evidence that heard APVMA staff were working in McDonald\u2019s for wifi in Armidale. APVMA is the agency Joyce moved to his electorate in the lead-up to the Tony Windsor fight at the last election. Labor\u2019s Joel Fitzgibbon said decentralisation? It rarely works at a federal level, says he. George Brandis could not recall when he had his first conversation with the WA attorney general Mischen about the Bell litigation, even though Mischen said it was a month earlier than Brandis told the Senate. The omnibus bill went through the lower house and it will sit in the Senate queue. That\u2019s your lot for the evening. Thanks to the brains trust Paul Karp, Katharine Murphy and Mike Bowers. Tomorrow is the last sitting day but who\u2019s counting. Herewith, some pics for your viewing pleasure. Nighty night. Senator Cory Bernardi is questioning in estimates. He has a case of a constituent who was asked to sign a childcare agreement with \u201cpriority of access\u201d guidelines which state the child could be kicked out of the centre with 14 days notice if a more needy family needed the place. He said needy families would include Indigenous families, low socioeconomic families, disabled families etc. Bernardi says this is wrong. The department spokesman says while his advice on the guidelines is correct, anecdotally no one is displaced. Usually the centres renegotiate with all their families to squeeze in the child in need. Education (and childcare) minister Simon Birmingham says he was not aware of this issue and would take it up. Department and minister suggest guidelines should be clarified to the practice. Curiouser and curiouser. I promised to confirm the quotes from the Liberal MP Ann Sudmalis regarding penalty rates. She told one of her local newspapers on the New South Wales south coast, the Illawarra Mercury, that the penalty cut was a gift. \u201cIt\u2019s not cutting wages, it\u2019s opening the door for more hours of employment and in a regional area like Gilmore, with almost double the national youth unemployment, that\u2019s a gift; that is a gift for our young people to get a foot in the door of employment,\u201d Ms Sudmalis told the Mercury. Asked if she supported the cuts, the MP reiterated the move was a good one for young workers and urged people to \u201clook more broadly than our own hip pocket\u201d. \u201cThere are some people who are very dependent on those penalty rates, and I get that and I understand that, but there are some others who might be able to pick up an extra day,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be opportunities for more people to get more work, rather than just people losing part of what they believe is \u2018I\u2019m working on a Sunday, I should get paid more\u2019. Labor has used question time to target her comments and by association Malcolm Turnbull who recently visited her electorate. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, is being pressed by Ben Fordham on 2GB about his leadership prospects. Fordham thinks he will be the next prime minister. My job is to be loyal to the prime minister ... that is the only thing I am concentrating on. I have lots of people who loathe me and fortunately some people who like me. You take the bouquets and brickbats and do the best you can. In the flurry of the day, I missed Labor agriculture shadow Joel Fitzgibbon, who replied to Barnaby Joyce on his decentralisation press conference. Fitzgibbon says it was more about shoring up seats in the coming Queensland state election. Fitzgibbon has been critical of the APVMA move to Armidale. He keeps talking about research and relationships with universities. By the way, the relationship with UNE is so good that they are camping in McDonald\u2019s. Barnaby Joyce said they would be located in UNE, but they are in McDonald\u2019s. The APVMA does no research as such. They analyse data provided to them by the big multinational companies. So, he doesn\u2019t understand what it does. On that basis, I don\u2019t think he fully comprehended the consequence of gutting the APVMA, an organisation that has lost half of its staff. In some areas of expertise, 50% of the people have walked out of the building. Now he is going to have some sort of cyberspace experiment where people will be working from their homes here in Canberra. Well that\u2019s hardly going to bolster the economy of Armidale. Fitzgibbon says decentralisation rarely works though he accepts that \u201cmoving the APVMA to Armidale can do no harm to Armidale\u201d. Decentralisation has rarely worked. Where it has worked, it\u2019s worked at the state level best. Where it has worked it has been successful because people have spent a long time developing a strategic plan and a transition. Barnaby Joyce has no strategic plan for the APVMA. It was a thought bubble. A thought bubble to shore him up in Armidale where Tony Windsor constantly defeats him at the ballot box. This is not a plan for decentralisation, this is a plan to get Barnaby Joyce re-elected. While the APVMA move may have been a plan to get re-elected by Joyce, Fitzgibbon cannot assert Windsor beat Joyce at the one and only election they fought. Joyce is here and Windsor is not. An emotional prime minister ends question time with a statement on the 75th anniversary of the sinking of the HMAS Perth. Bill Shorten follows with his own speech. Put up your dukes. Sudmalis has been taunted about a visit to her electorate with Turnbull and her comments on penalty rates. I will confirm those comments. Labor to Turnbull: Given the prime minister\u2019s statement yesterday that he supports the decision to cut penalty rates, can the prime minister confirm his colleague, the Liberal member for Ford, was reflecting government policy when he said in relation to the decision to cut penalty rates, \u201cThe reductions are minor.\u201d For this prime minister, is a $77 per week pay cut just a minor reduction? ? Turnbull does not answer this $77 question. He repeats, the FWC is an independent umpire. Shorten made the referral on penalty rates as minister. Shorten also negotiated away penalties as a union leader. Labor to Turnbull: Yesterday during question time, the prime minister finally confirmed he supports a decision to cut penalty rates. The prime minister\u2019s support for cutting penalty rates means workers at the cane land central shopping centre in Mackay in the electorate of Dawson will have their pay cut. Is the reason the prime minister is refusing to stop the penalty rates decision is because he and his Liberal-National government, including the member for Dawson [George Christensen], support cuts to penalty rates. Turnbull: This is abandoning every principle of the Labor party, and as Jenny George said, in words that honourable members opposite should reflect on very carefully, be careful what you wish for. The independent umpire has served workers well, it has served employers well, it has served Australia well. Decisions have been controversial, to be sure. But backing the independent umpire has been a joint commitment for many years, now abandoned as a politically cynical effort by the Labor party and their hypocritical leader. Labor to Turnbull: My question is to the prime minister and I refer to the prime minister\u2019s recent visit to the electorate of Gilmore, and the member for Gilmore\u2019s statement yesterday that it is a gift for our young people that their penalty rates have been cut. On that visit, did the prime minister and the member tell the people of Gilmore that it was government policy to cut their penalty rates? And why does the prime minister and the member for Gilmore support cutting penalty rates of Australians? Turnbull says it is the FWC\u2019s judgement and their judgment alone. Their judgment and their judgement alone, is that these reductions in this case a reduction for casuals from 275% penalty rate to 250%, that that reduction will assist in creating more job opportunities. That was the trade-off. Turnbull quotes Shorten prior to the election, warning off the Greens from changing any (future) FWC decision. [Shorten said] I caution the Greens from their sideshow position. They need be careful of what they\u2019re playing with fire by proposing a government should be able to legislate on specific penalty rate outcomes. They are loading the gun for a future conservative government to pull the trigger because what a government has the power to put in, a future government has the ability to dismantle. A couple of comments here. A: Let\u2019s not pretend the government does not support the penalty rate cut. They clearly do, but they will not crow about it, lest they give material to Labor for future election ads. B: I agree with this previous Shorten position. Once you change the FWC decisions you don\u2019t like, you licence future governments to do the same. There is argy bargy between the speaker, the government and Labor over the latter\u2019s call for relevance. Speaker Smith rules Turnbull is relevant because he is talking about the penalty rate cut decision (albeit in regard to Shorten\u2019s previous work at the AWU). Labor\u2019s Tony Burke to Turnbull: Have any ministers disclosed potential conflicts of interest in relation to the Governments response to the recent Fair Work Commission decision as required by the statement of ministerial standards? How many members of the Government will profit from the decision? Turnbull says it is not the government\u2019s decision, it is from the Fair Work Commission. So this would be an interesting question, whether a small business owner and politician would have a conflict of interest on a penalty rate decision made by an independent body. (Given the small business operator would benefit from a cut in penalties.) I think it\u2019s a long bow myself but let\u2019s watch where it goes. *this post has been amended to correct the question. Labor to Turnbull: This morning on Adelaide radio the assistant minister for agriculture said \u201cThe overall decision of this commission, which I have got to say I support, being a small business operator. \u201c. Have any ministers disclosed potential conflicts of interest in relation to the government\u2019s response to this decision, as required by the statement of ministerial standards? How many more members of the government will profit from the decision to cut the pay of 700,000 Australians? Turnbull does not answer the question, which references Anne Ruston, the assistant ag minister and primary producer. He talks about Bill Shorten\u2019s negotiated EBAs with Cleanevent and Cirque Du Soleil. Bob Katter to immigration minister Peter Dutton: The The Daily Telegraph, October 2014 reports young New South Wales is the unofficial Muslim capital of the outback, population 7,000 Arabic as the second language and home to 400 Middle Easterners. Yesterday, Haisem Zahab was arrested on allegations of assisting ISIS to develop long range missiles. Last week the Federation of Islamic Councils President reportedly stated domestic violence is the last resort. Will the minister listen to his own backbench and the United States and ban visas from North Africa and the countries between Greece and India, exempting of course persecuted minorities, namely Sikhs, Jews and Christians? Dutton makes three points. One. It is important to point out that the vast majority of people who are working hard in that community, supporting the abattoir that can only stay open because of that local Muslim population, it provides support to local farmers and to that local economy. They are hard working people. They are doing the right thing. Like 99% of people from the Islamic community in this country, they are doing the right thing. Two. Where we find the 1% and where the 1% are doing the wrong thing or people who would seek to do harm to our country, we will come down on them hard. Three, re Keyser Trad\u2019s comments: This is Australia and if you come to our country, you abide by our laws and one of the things that sets us apart from many other nations is our respect of women\u201d we all want our daughters to succeed, be in loving relationships,get a good education, get a good job and be the equal of any man in this country\u201d. It is unacceptable for the vast majority of the Islamic community as well, I am sure. Shorten to Turnbull: The prime minister has said he supports the decision to cut penalty rates. Will the prime minister please advise the 700,000 Australians who rely upon these penalty rates whether he will intervene to stop these pay cuts? Yes or no, will the commonwealth intervene to stop these pay cuts? He notes correctly that Shorten said he would accept the decision of the Fair Work Commission on penalty rates. It does not look like there will be an answer from the PM on the substantive issue of whether he supports the penalty rate cut. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: This morning at Senate estimates the secretary of the Treasury was asked whether the decision to cut penalty rates would create more jobs. The secretary said \u201cI don\u2019t have an opinion on that\u201d. Can the treasurer confirm that his own department has not advised the government that this will create jobs and in fact this is just a straight pay cut for 700,000 Australians? Morrison says the Fair Work Commission has decided to cut penalty rates following the referral from Bill Shorten, former workplace minister. Morrison again declines the opportunity to give Labor a grab lauding pay cuts that could be used in the next election. Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s first Dorothy Dixer spruiks the national accounts. The question comes from a WA MP which allows him to talk about the strong economic leadership of his government and WA premier Colin Barnett. Can I hear a state election coming? Shorten to Turnbull: Why is it that under the Turnbull government, when companies receive record profits, they get tax cuts and when wages flat line, workers get pay cuts? Turnbull is shuffling through a pile of enterprise bargaining agreements signed by Bill Shorten\u2019s delegates at the Australian Workers Union under his leadership. What about the workers? The cleaning workers at Cleanevent who were paid thanks to the leader of the opposition $18.14 an hour when they were entitled to $50.17 under the award. That is what he did. Where did the money go? Was there a payment to the AWU? Were membership lists provided to the AWU? Follow the money. Bill Shorten is using a 90 second MP\u2019s statement just before question time to speak against changing the Racial Discrimination Act. The ball is now in the prime minister\u2019s court He should rule out the right to be a bigot once and for all. Cory Bernardi has delivered his Weekly Dose of Common Sense blog. He is using the 18C report by the human rights committee as a bit of a recruitment drive for Australian Conservatives. The committee bowed at the altar of political correctness, they heeded the caution of the saturated mattress. It is time to take a stand, says Cory. This snowflake-protecting, damaging ideology and its proponents are hurting our country. If the political class won\u2019t support freedom of speech what will they support? What other of your freedoms will they limit to make their already-cosy lives easier? There really is a better way\u2026a principled way that does the right thing no matter how tough it is. That\u2019s the attitude parents have shared with their children for generations. Do the right thing, do it once and do it right. Our political class need to hear that message loud and clear. Australian Conservatives are committed to taking it to them. He notes he will name founding members in weeks to come. Bernardi really is the master of the political tease. From Matt Hatter with love: I should say Barnaby also launched a website for anyone who would like to make a submission on decentralisation. We have been trying to get the major parties to engage in the conversation about decentralisation, which is growing jobs in regional Australia and saving government money by relocating government agencies out of the major cities. Which sounds like the Nationals are not part of the government. In keeping with good blogging practice, herewith a lunch time summary. As predicted by Scott Morrison and the consensus, the national accounts were good. The economy grew by 1.1% in the December quarter - the best one quarter result since March 2012, and comes off the back of the September quarter result which saw the economy shrink by 0.5%. Recession under the technical terms has been avoided. Again. Barnaby Joyce says evidence given in senate estimates APVMA workers had to access wifi at McDonalds was ridiculous. The agency was moved to his own electorate based in Armidale. Joyce was calling for towns across regional Australia to put in a bid for their own agency through a senate committee on decentralisation. Former Howard minister Amanda Vanstone said Tony Abbott was a narcissist. Julie Bishop said he wasn\u2019t. The omnibus social services/childcare bill passed the lower house. Indi independent Cathy McGowan tried to amend it to put some structure around mobile childcare funding for regional Oz but it was voted down by the government. Treasury head John Fraser said the demographics of immigration meant migrants did have an effect on house prices. Treasurer Scott Morrison has been speaking on the national accounts. He covers the numbers, the company tax cuts and their passage through the Senate and the increase in commodity prices. While Treasury secretary John Fraser suggested in estimates earlier today that any increase in revenue should be banked, Morrison said it was too early to be definitive and he would consider Treasury forecasts in the lead up to the budget. He is pushed again on why the government will not prosecute the yes case for the Fair Work Commission\u2019s decision on penalty rate cuts. He steadfastly refuses to do this. He just says the government supports the independent umpire and will abide by the decision. Who is that man? Would you like fries with that? The GDP figures out today showed the economy grew by a rather stunning 1.1% in the December quarter. That is the best one quarter result since March 2012, and comes off the back of the September quarter result which saw the economy shrink by 0.5%. While the figure is very good, there needs to be a bit of caution before you limber up to do cartwheels. One reason the figure is so strong is because the September quarter figures were so bad \u2013 and they were bad for a number of one-off reasons, including bad weather which reduced housing construction. So it\u2019s not like the economy has suddenly got a lot better, more we just didn\u2019t suffer the same bad events in December that occurred in September The annual growth figures of 2.4% remains below the long term average (historically a figure of 3%, but now considered to be closer to 2.75%). Also the big 1.1% growth figure is the seasonally adjusted figure which can be a bit erratic. The trend growth figure is a rather less ebullient 0.3%, and the trend annual growth figure is a fairly pathetic 1.9%. The big driver of growth was household consumption \u2013 which contributed nearly half of the 1.1% growth \u2013 exports and also non-dwelling construction. There is good news for the government from the nominal growth figures. Nominal GDP measure the size of the economy in current dollars and this figure has more of an impact for government tax revenue. In the December quarter nominal growth grew by 3.0% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 the best result since June 2010. It means nominal GDP grew by 6.1% in 2016. Given the December mid-year fiscal and economic outlook estimated growth for 2016-17 of 5.75%, that is good news for the budget figures. The house is now voting on the omnibus bill. As the National party was doing its thing, the house voted down a very detailed amendment from Indi independent Cathy McGowan. Her amendment sought to put some structure and process around mobile community childcare funding which seeks to fill the gaps in childcare places in rural and regional towns. It would require the government to assess hard data around the number of places in various areas so that it provides a more transparent process and funding. McGowan said the minister had been helpful, but was only offering grants and guidelines without a permanent process. She said especially for the National party, this policy affected poor and needy women in rural Australia, including Indigenous communities. In speaking to the bill, McGowan had a warning for the major parties. You are already bleeding votes and until you start recognising that regional communities have different needs (and responding to them), you will lose more votes to minor parties. Labor voted for the McGowan amendment but the Coalition including the National party voted against. Australia\u2019s economy has rebounded, recording 1.1% growth in the December 2016 quarter. The result reverses the shock negative result in the September quarter and means Australia has avoided a recession, as was widely projected by market economists. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday show Australia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has now grown 2.4% through the year. Australia has now recorded 101 quarters between the June 1991 and the 2016 December quarter without two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. Australia continues to close in on the Netherlands\u2019 record of 103 quarters without a recession, which Deloitte Access Economics has predicted it will surpass this year. Someone left a bag of Macca\u2019s on the lawn in the courtyard when the National party emerged for its press conference. There is no clear answer from Barnaby Joyce on whether he supports a \u201cdebranding\u201d of the Nats from the Liberals in Queensland. He does say he has been going to Queensland regularly. People clearly understand who we are. I\u2019ve never had anybody confused which party I\u2019m in. So to be clear, the National party has started a Senate inquiry and has urged rural and regional towns across Australia to make a bid for a government office. Barnaby Joyce says the Nats don\u2019t need to carve out a new identity because they already have a strong identity. This relates to the idea that in Queensland, the Nats in the LNP want a separate identity. Asked about APVMA expertise is being lost, Joyce says: Well, we\u2019ve also had an awful lot of inquiries about people who want to work there. Everything balances off. Barnaby Joyce says the APVMA workers have plenty of office space. They don\u2019t need to work from McDonald\u2019s. This is ridiculous. There are so many areas up there if they wish to have office space, they could get it. Armidale was one of the first cities to get the NBN. So the idea that you have to work out of Macca\u2019s is a choice that they\u2019ve made. I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by people saying it was ridiculous and there was office space if they wanted it. Barnaby Joyce is freewheeling on the benefits of decentralisation. He says Bob Hawke previously supported some decentralisation. As did Gough Whitlam BTW. But I digress. Here is Barnaby: What\u2019s happened to the Labor Party is it\u2019s lost a vision for the nation and it\u2019s become myopic and is going into the parochial paces of saying they\u2019re going to support where things already are. If that was the vision that was around at the time that they developed the constitution for our nation, before federation,we would not be having this press conference here. There would be a city called Melbourne and a city called Sydney and one of them would be slightly bigger because all of the administrative centres would be there. Julie Bishop also spoke about her plans to bring home more than 100 diplomatic staff to nut out Australia\u2019s foreign policy. We hear from them through communications all the time but what we are seeking to do is replace the meetings and the regional meetings that occur regionally or around the world with one significant meeting to gain the insights and perspectives of our most experienced diplomats. In fact, it\u2019s within the budget. There is no new money required and I believe it\u2019s a very efficient and effective way of hearing from them on their experiences, observations, their real-time experiences. These are people situated in countries, in our missions across the globe, over 100 missions, and they are coming back to Australia to be part of our white paper on foreign policy. By the way, former Howard minister Amanda Vanstone (again) calls Tony Abbott a narcissist. It\u2019s always been about Tony from the minute he was born. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has been asked about it. Is Tony Abbott a narcissist? That\u2019s not how I\u2019d describe him. Hey kids, join the Department of Finance and you get to eat paleo pear and banana bread. This little video to applaud the features of the department\u2019s graduate program drew a questioning in estimates last night. And a little tittering. But don\u2019t laugh too hard. There may be a future head of treasury in there. Jenny Macklin was trying to knock off the omnibus bill because: It will hurt pensioners, families, new mums and young Australians while holding childcare assistance and the National Disability Insurance Scheme to ransom; The motion also called on the government to: (a) drop their unfair cuts to pensioners, families, new mums and young Australians; and (b) fix their childcare changes so that vulnerable and disadvantaged children are not worse off and Indigenous and country services do not face closure. The Labor motion failed. The lower house has moved onto the omnibus/social services/childcare bill. Labor\u2019s Jenny Macklin is trying to amend the legislation. The house in voting now and we could expect on the numbers Labor will lose this vote. Let\u2019s just touch base on the morning We have GDP figures coming out at 11.30am. We have the leader of Nationals, Barnaby Joyce, and Nationals members and senators launching a new decentralisation campaign at 11am. Which will be a chance for journalists to quiz him on the workers from the APVMA from Canberra to Joyce\u2019s electorate. AAP reported late yesterday from estimates committee: Senior executives at a pesticides agency being forcibly moved to the electorate of deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce are working from a fast food restaurant as they search for a temporary office. A dozen staff at the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority were due to move to regional NSW in March but their hunt for Armidale real estate continues. \u201cWe need a base rather than sitting in McDonald\u2019s using their free wifi,\u201d chief executive Kareena Arthy told a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Tuesday. \u201cIt [the office] is there really as a practical basis for the APVMA staff who go to Armidale because honestly we sit in McDonald\u2019s to do our work.\u201d Let me explain the shenanigans in the house. The government introduced two bills, one on vulnerable workers and one to remove the requirement of the Fair Work Commission to conduct four-yearly reviews of modern awards from the beginning of 1 January 2018. Labor supports these bills. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, introduced them, said they were urgent. So Labor called his bluff and said effectively, bloody oath. Let\u2019s push them through right now. Dutton said, yeah, nah. We don\u2019t want to do it right now. So Labor suspended standing orders in the house to allow the bills to be rushed through. The house has just voted against the motion to suspend standing orders. The house was debating the fair work amendment on vulnerable workers. Tony Burke tried to suspend standing orders to debate. The government gagged him. Then Anthony Albanese tried to take up the suspension motion. The government is now in the process of gagging Albanese. The house starts at 9.30am and begins with government business. The government will introduce a bill to protect vulnerable workers, the omnibus social services/childcare bill and the NDIS savings fund (created for the savings out of the omnibus bill). It is the way of governments to rally their base to help push for policy arguments they support. But it would seem there is a little fraying at the edges in the business community over the recent penalty cuts decision by the Fair Work Commission. Phil Coorey at the Fin reports that the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, has been on the phone to business groups to gear up for an expected fight from Labor, the Greens and unions for the hearts and votes of the 680,000 people effected by the decision. Senator Cash called the Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, the Australian Chamber of Commerce CEO, James Pearson, and the Australian Industry Group\u2019s Innes Willox. \u201cAs part of this discussion they discussed the disgraceful misinformation campaign being waged by unions in relation to the Fair Work Commission\u2019s penalty rate decision,\u201d a spokesman for Senator Cash said. But the BCA argued its members, the nation\u2019s 127 largest businesses, were not directly affected by the decision and therefore it was not the BCA\u2019s fight. Willox told the Fin that his group, which argued in support of the FWC, would continue to speak in support but business risked a backlash if they spoke out individually. Our members and the business community generally are very pleased with the decision but individual business are understandably reluctant to speak up, knowing the risk of union intimidation, thuggery, boycotts or protests. Thanks to Matt Doran of the ABC for another Brandis snippet. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, was nonplussed by all the talk about changing 18c, an issue which exercises the conservative end of the Coalition. As reported earlier, he said it would not create a single job. Labor\u2019s Ed Husic said it was a joke that the Coalition was now fighting over the outcomes of the human rights committee report, which gave a range of recommendations without any clear call to change the act. Rather, the committee suggested the processes around complaints under the Racial Discrimination Act should change in the first instance. There is disappointment in some quarters of the government and relief in others. Husic says: They are fighting about an inquiry they pushed for. They are hatin\u2019 about hate speech. Today, senate estimates continue and the lower house sits at 9.30am. Community affairs committee has the health department so I\u2019m thinking Medicare freeze. Economics has treasury head, John Fraser, as well as the Australian Tax Office. Defence will have the defence minister Marise Payne in the comfy chair. We could see questioning around the Singapore-Australian military training deal which threatened compulsory land acquisitions, among other things. Education might consider the new education funding agreements yet to be unveiled - the so-called years 5-6 of Gonski and we have the education minister Simon Birmingham in the chair. Aforementioned Murray Watt and George Brandis exchange words. The Queensland Liberal MP Karen Andrews has given a message on Sky to her fellow members. Knuckle down, she says. But she praised George Christensen for doing the right thing and stepping down as whip. Labor senator Murray Watt gives a physical impression of WTF. The chairman of Universities Australia, Barney Glover, is due to make an interesting speech to the National Press Club today in defence of experts. I know experts are pass\u00e9 but there is something to be said for listening to people who know stuff. Paul Karp reports Glover will say the public square has been overrun by \u201cextremists and polemicists\u201d in the post-truth era. He will warn of a \u201ccreeping cynicism \u2013 even outright hostility \u2013 towards evidence and expertise\u201d. Who can forget British Conservative MP Michael Gove declaring after the Brexit vote that \u201cthe people of this country have had enough of experts\u201d? Glover will say that expertise is needed to solve problems as broad as curing cancer and preventable disease, navigating technological disruption, lifting living standards, overcoming prejudice and preventing catastrophic climate change. What a quaint notion. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, has spoken on ABC\u2019s AM about the GDP figures out today. He says it is \u201ccertainly the consensus\u201d that it will be a positive figure \u2013 avoiding a technical recession after the shock 0.5% contraction last quarter. It was a surprise contraction and it\u2019s my expectation that that will be corrected in today\u2019s figures. Host Sabra Lane pushes Morrison on whether the government will separate tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of $10m or less because the Senate won\u2019t back a tax cut for big business. The treasurer says the \u201cSenate will decide\u201d, implying it\u2019s all or nothing, but doesn\u2019t say so explicitly. Asked about the Fair Work Commission cuts to penalty rates, Morrison repeats the mantra that it\u2019s not the government\u2019s decision to defend but then does back it more strongly than many of his colleagues. You can\u2019t get a job and you can\u2019t get hours in a business that isn\u2019t open.\u201d He said the commission had heard \u201ccase after case after case\u201d of small business owners who said they work on Sunday because they can\u2019t afford other workers, demonstrating a rate cut could boost employment. Morrison cited the seat of Gilmore, which has 20% youth unemployment, as a place that could benefit from the decision. Asked about 18C after a Senate report failed to recommend any particular method to amend the section, Morrison said that he was focused on the budget and changes to the Racial Discrimination Act would not create \u201cone job\u201d. Good morning blogans and blatherskites, Welcome to the first day of autumn, when Canberra turns to colour and not just in the halls of parliament. Last night, after the legal and constitutional affairs Senate committee managed to put off the attorney general\u2019s statement regarding the Bell litigation for most of the day, Brandis eventually gave a statement. (He had tried earlier in the day but chair Ian Macdonald put him off.) He was required to make the statement because, in November, he told the Senate that the first \u201cpersonal involvement\u201d he could recall in the matter was \u201con 3 March [2016], although my office had been dealing with the matter prior to that time\u201d. But on Thursday Andrew Probyn of ABC\u2019s 7.30 reported that Brandis spoke to the Western Australian attorney general, Michael Mischin, about Bell on 1 February 2016, although Brandis said he had no recollection of it. In a joint letter demanding Brandis explain the inconsistency, signed by Penny Wong, Richard Di Natale, Derryn Hinch and Nick Xenophon, the group warned the Senate treats misleading statements \u201cvery seriously\u201d. Last night, Brandis repeatedly told the committee he could not recall the exchange and it would really mislead the Senate if he said he could recall. At the time I made my November 28 statement, I had no recollection of the exchange to which Mr Mischin refers. I still have no recollection of it. Were I to say that I recall such an exchange, I would be misleading the Senate, because I do not. I will have more on this throughout the morning. Katharine Murphy reports that the former treasurer Wayne Swan is going to come out in support of the Buffett rule, where high earners pay a minimum tax rate. The idea is opposed by the current shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, so that will make for some lively caucus debate. Swan says working people voted for Donald Trump \u201cnot out of any hard-right ideology or an entrenched racial intolerance but because they no longer saw the Democrats as the party who spoke or acted for them\u201d. Consider if you\u2019re a truck driver in Logan or a steel worker in Wollongong, you\u2019re constantly told to work harder for less while tax cuts go to the top end \u2013 you might suck that up for a while because you have to,\u201d Swan will say. \u201cAll the while you see progressive social issues dominate the news. Eventually you reach a breaking point and your job is sent offshore or made casual. \u201cSuddenly you\u2019re tossed on the economic scrapheap and, like a drum of kerosene dumped directly on the smouldering fire, your frustration with progressive issues erupts in an inferno of white-hot rage. \u201cAnd quite a lot of that rage might express itself with immigration, gender equity or other favoured progressive issues \u2013 not because rage by definition doesn\u2019t contain itself very well but very much because the right will always supply scapegoats of various types. Anything to ensure the blame isn\u2019t sheeted home where it really belongs: the policies they designed to fleece working people and redistribute the gains to the top. George Christensen is feeling the anger. Phil Coorey at the Fin reports that Christensen and fellow Queensland LNP MPs are pushing for a \u201cdebranding\u201d of the LNP to respond to it. That is, separating the brands of the Liberal and National party in a state that merged the two parties in 2008. There is a growing view among MPs and others that there should not be a demerger but a debranding,\u201d he said. This would include, but not be limited to, resorting to the use of separate National and Liberal party logos on electoral material and ballot papers. This merger crankiness has been an ongoing headache for the Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce. Over the past year, he has made a number of mercy dashes to Queensland to try to sort out the angst caused by the threat of One Nation. John Howard\u2019s view of the Nats was that they played an important function in holding the space on the right. Sucking them into the one party leaves the parking space open for parties on the right. Like One Nation. Like Cory Bernardi\u2019s Australian Conservatives. In other news, Amy Remeikis of Fairfax reports that foreign minister Julie Bishop is recalling all Australian ambassadors for a three day meeting to map out Australia\u2019s strategic foreign policy. Mike Bowers was up late at the Brandis committee so I have more treasures to unveil. Talk to us in the thread or on the Twits @gabriellechan and @mpbowers. My Facebook page is also open for business.

Speaking to a joint sitting of the houses of Congress on Tuesday night in Washington, Trump promised to reform the US immigration system and cited other Anglosphere countries as exemplars. \u201cNations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others \u2013 have a merit-based immigration system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. \u201cYet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America\u2019s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. \u201cSwitching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration and instead adopting a merit-based system will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers\u2019 wages and help struggling families \u2013 including immigrant families \u2013 enter the middle class.\u201d Trump did not cite his source in his speech but the National Academy of Sciences has published a comprehensive examination of migration called The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration. That publication, which is more than 300,000 words, did not put a price on the US immigration policy but said: \u201cOn average, [immigrant] individuals in the first generation are more costly to governments, mainly at the state and local levels, than are the native-born generations; however, immigrants\u2019 children \u2013 the second generation \u2013 are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.\u201d The US has a much larger immigration program than Australia. About 1 million people have been granted lawful permanent residency in the US every year since 2001. The US program is also much more heavily weighted \u2013 about 70% \u2013 towards family-based migration. About 15% is employment-based and 15% humanitarian. Australia accepted 262,170 permanent migrants in 2016 (many of those people were already living in Australia on temporary visas). Of them, 148,679 (57%) were skilled migrants, 88,639 (34%) came to Australia through the family migration scheme, and 24,852 (9%) were part of Australia\u2019s humanitarian stream. Several studies in Australia have demonstrated the economic benefit of Australia\u2019s migration program. A Migration Council of Australia report said migration had a \u201cprofound positive impact not just on population growth, but also on labour participation and employment, on wages and incomes, on our national skills base and on net productivity\u201d. \u201cAustralia\u2019s projected population will be 38 million by 2050 and migration will be contributing $1,625bn ($1.6tn) to Australia\u2019s GDP. Moreover, migration will have added 15.7% to our workforce participation rate, 21.9% to after-tax real wages for low-skilled workers and\u0083 5.9% in GDP per-capita growth.\u201d",

Cash Converters was last year investigated by the corporate regulator for unscrupulous and irresponsible lending through its payday loans scheme, which offers small amounts of credit over short periods of time at high interest. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) found Cash Converters had offered loans without properly checking an individual\u2019s ability to repay, and relied on an internally-generated benchmark to make assumptions about their expenses that \u201chad no relationship to the real expenses of the individual consumer\u201d. The company late last year promised to refund 118,000 small credit contracts worth $10.8m, and pay Asic $1.35m in fines. But the enforceable undertaking agreed to by Asic and Cash Converters only saw refunds go to individuals who applied for the loans online between July 2013 and June 2016. Those who applied for loans in-store missed out on any refund, prompting criticism that Asic\u2019s investigation and the subsequent agreement were inadequate. Now, the Consumer Action Law Centre has launched court action on behalf of one individual who could not achieve compensation through the Asic-Cash Converters agreement. The low-income Victorian woman, a mother of seven, was allegedly allowed to take out 23 payday loans and 76 pawnbroking agreements by Cash Converters. The pawnbroking agreements had an effective interest rate of between 360% and 420% per annum, according to the centre. The centre alleges the payday loans were \u201cunsuitable and did not comply with responsible lending laws\u201d, and that repayments caused her substantial hardship. The centre\u2019s legal practice director, Jillian Williams, said the case was not isolated.

Asic encouraged anyone with concerns about a Cash Converters loan, either in-store or online, to lodge a complaint with the credit and investments ombudsman. \u201cIt is important to note that anyone with concerns can certainly have their case heard,\u201d he said. The centre\u2019s senior policy officer, Katherine Temple, said Asic\u2019s decision to omit in-store customers as \u201codd\u201d at best. \u201cReally, anyone who has been given a loan who has been assessed using these ridiculous benchmarks should be entitled to compensation,\u201d Temple said. The federal government last year agreed to all recommendations made by a government-commissioned review of small amount credit contract laws, which urged for changes to better protect vulnerable borrowers. Williams urged the government to act on those recommendations. She also warned state government regulations around pawnbroking agreements tended to be far weaker than those for payday loans, which were regulated at a federal level. She said there were concerns that lenders would turn to pawnbroking to avoid red tape. \u201cIt\u2019s a really critical gap in the protections \u2026 and our concern is that it will be easier for lenders to use pawnbroking to avoid red tape,\u201d she said. Cash Converters said it was unable to comment on the court proceedings. But it said it continued to work collaboratively with Asic and took its integrity responsibilities very seriously. \u201cCash Converters operates in a heavily regulated industry and we believe that we have an open and constructive relationship with the regulators, including working closely with Asic,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe are well aware of our compliance obligations and one of our ongoing objectives is full compliance with the legislative and regulatory environment in which we operate.\u201d The spokeswoman said there was scope for improvement in the industry.

      "bodyText": "Australia could be heading into another El Ni\u00f1o year according to new analysis by the Bureau of Meteorology, which found the chance Australia would be affected by the phenomenon in 2017 had increased to 50%. Six of the eight models used by Australian climatologists to predict El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events indicate the El Ni\u00f1o threshold could be reached by July, while seven indicate a steady warming in the Pacific Ocean over the next six months. El Ni\u00f1o is declared when temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean are 0.8C above average, and brings a dry winter and spring to southern Australia and a warmer than average spring and summer to the eastern states. It comes as the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) confirmed Sydney had just experienced its hottest summer on record, with mean temperatures 2.8C above the long-term average. Sydney experienced a record-breaking 26 days of 30C or higher and 11 days of 35C or higher. In 2015 Pacific Ocean temperatures increased to 2C above average, causing the most severe El Ni\u00f1o since the late 1990s. BoM manager of climate prediction services, Dr Andrew Watkins, said it could mean a return to difficult conditions for Australian farmers after what he described as a \u201cneutral\u201d year in 2016, which produced the best season in decades for Australian grain growers. \u201cWe have been seeing a fairly steady warming up of those waters [in the tropical Pacific Ocean] since the start of the year,\u201d Watkins said. The trend is significant enough to place Australia on El Ni\u00f1o \u201cwatch\u201d, which occurs when the chance of El Ni\u00f1o rises to 50%. In any given year the chance of El Ni\u00f1o sits at 25%, Watkins said, so a watch status means it is twice as likely to occur. If the probability increases to 70%, which would usually be accompanied by a warming of at least 0.5C, the status will be upgraded from \u201cwatch\u201d to \u201calert\u201d. However Watkins said the models used to predict the trend are less accurate in autumn, because \u201cthat\u2019s typically the time of year where events break down or develop.\u201d \u201cThere can be fairly rapid changes at times, the Pacific is most volatile at this time of year,\u201d he said. Watkins said the number of El Ni\u00f1o events had increased in recent years, but that should not be read as a trend, saying the 20th century showed a number of \u201cclustered\u201d El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events, surrounded by years of relative steadiness. Since 2006 Australia has experienced two years of El Ni\u00f1o and two of La Ni\u00f1a, but the former were more severe.",

After the Kaikoura earthquake and the surprise of losing our prime minister before his term was out, we lusted for the Kiwi summer. The year had felt long, turbulent and tiring. We needed summer, because everyone felt bruised and battered by 2016. We needed her warm temperatures to soften our bones and untwist the knots in our spine. We needed to feel coal-hot bitumen burn our bare feet, and taste bland sausages charred on the barbecue. The Pacific Ocean called too, wondering when I\u2019d visit for a swim, opening my mouth wide in her depths to let the salt and bubbles scour my throat. But summer, in the south especially, never showed. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research has called it one of the worst New Zealand summers on record. Cloudy and windy in the capital Wellington, and unusually cold in the south island, with 50cm of snow falling in January. Weather patterns are to blame. Climate change is to blame. It doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 she didn\u2019t show. There were two severe weather bombs, cutting off west coast farming towns and peppering Dunedin streets with handfuls of hail. From my cottage, I stared out at the manic weather hurling itself against my sash windows, making them shake and squeal. Running out of wood, I burnt the rotten fence palings under my house, and then used all my back-issues of the Guardian Weekly for kindling. My new summer dress, silky and slippery, stayed unworn, and the fresh bottle of gin, which needs laughter and sticky evenings, remained unopened. \u201cI have heard it is coming, just late,\u201d said a taxi driver in February, inching slowly through flooded Dunedin streets, garbage clogging up the sewage grates. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it isn\u2019t coming at all,\u201d said another, morosely. \u201cWe\u2019ve just lost it this year.\u201d In the southern hemisphere, summer marks the transition of old year to new. Winter skin is sloughed off to tan and freckle beneath the hole in our ozone layer, and kilos disappear on the light summer fare of salads, stone fruit and seafood. Active antipodean summers give Kiwis the vigour to start the new year afresh; a rebirth through sand, sea and nubile limbs; playing cricket, climbing trees and tramping. Summer\u2019s charged with restoring our worn spirits, giving us long days for play and idleness, at the beach, at the park or even in the urban backyard, with a chilly bin full of Speights at hand. But this year, we were deprived. The light touch of summer passed us by. Work began without enviable holiday stories to share, golden shoulders to show off, or sandy romances to remember.

      "bodyText": "The breakaway Liberal senator Cory Bernardi is using the failure of a parliamentary committee to recommend changes to 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act as a recruitment drive for his new Australian Conservatives movement. Bernardi, who led the renewed push inside the Liberal party to overhaul 18C immediately after last year\u2019s federal election, before parting ways with the government this year, has pounced on the lack of resolution from the committee process. In his weekly email missive to supporters, Bernardi declared it was time to take a stand. \u201cThis snowflake-protecting, damaging ideology and its proponents are hurting our country,\u201d the South Australian senator wrote. \u201cThe 18C scandal takes on new importance as identity politics and the competing rights agenda are used by the left to undermine civil society. \u201cThe fact that a number of members of the committee couldn\u2019t break out of that nexus suggests that the PC infection has contaminated swathes of the Liberal party too. \u201cIf the political class won\u2019t support freedom of speech what will they support? What other of your freedoms will they limit to make their already-cosy lives easier?\u201d Bernardi says Australian Conservatives is committed to taking the free speech message up to the \u201cpolitical class\u201d, and notes \u201cthousands of people have already joined the movement, determined to change politics\u201d. He notes that founding memberships are open until 7 March. On Tuesday the parliament\u2019s human rights committee tabled a bipartisan report after a three-month public inquiry floating 22 options for the Turnbull government to consider \u2013 but the new report stops short of making specific recommendations on legislative changes to the RDA because the committee members could not reach consensus. The lack of a settled roadmap puts the ball firmly back in the prime minister\u2019s court, and will ensure that the rolling controversy over the RDA returns both to the cabinet and the Coalition party room for a third significant phase of debate. Backbenchers have already resumed the government\u2019s long-running internal argument, with the Liberal party\u2019s right faction arguing in favour of legislative change to 18C, and party moderates arguing the only change necessary to the current regime is procedural. Senior ministers have moved to play down the need for urgent action on 18C. On Wednesday, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said reforming 18C would not create jobs or make housing more affordable. \u201cI\u2019m focused on people\u2019s wages, I\u2019m focused on people\u2019s investment and I know this issue doesn\u2019t create one job, doesn\u2019t open one business, doesn\u2019t give anyone one extra hour, it doesn\u2019t reduce the cost or make housing more affordable or energy more affordable,\u201d Morrison said. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, told reporters the resolution of the 18C issue was a matter for discussion in the cabinet and party room. She said reforming 18C was an issue \u201crarely raised\u201d in her electorate, and she was focused on \u201cpresenting a foreign policy white paper to protect our interests around the world as an open, liberal democracy based on human rights, the rule of law, institutions and an export-oriented market economy\u201d. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, used a statement to parliament to echo Morrison\u2019s formulation about changes to 18C not making any positive contribution to job creation. \u201cGiving a green light to racism won\u2019t solve the traffic jams in the great suburbs of Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not help pensioners pay for their bills.\u201d Shorten declared the 18C debate was a metaphor for the Turnbull government: \u201cDivided down the middle, two camps, and no one in charge.\u201d He said Turnbull should rule out the \u201cright to be a bigot, once and for all\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s human services minister, Alan Tudge, relied on legal guidelines in parliament to justify the release of personal information to the media that his own department now says are irrelevant. Tudge was criticised in parliament on Tuesday for releasing the personal details of welfare recipient Andie Fox, who was critical of Centrelink\u2019s handling of her debt. Lawyers and welfare groups have already warned that the decision to release Fox\u2019s details was legally debatable. Tudge sought to justify the release of Fox\u2019s details by relying on a part of social security law that he said allows personal information to be disclosed to correct the public record. But the powers he claims were used directly contradict his own department\u2019s comments and only relate to disclosing information by the secretary to the minister. Labor\u2019s Linda Burney said Tudge\u2019s justification for the release of Fox\u2019s details was \u201cconfused at best\u201d and said that the controversial decision would be pursued again during Senate estimates on Thursday. \u201cThe minister is arguing that his actions were legal; the fact is they certainly weren\u2019t ethical,\u201d she said. \u201cYesterday I moved to suspend the parliament so that Mr Tudge could explain himself. Now it looks like his explanation to the house was confused at best. Mr Tudge has to come clean.\u201d Tudge told parliament on Tuesday that he and the agency he oversees were entitled to release Fox\u2019s information. \u201cWe are able under the Social Services Act to release information about the person for the purposes of, as I quote, \u2018correcting a mistake of fact, a misleading perception or impression or a misleading statement in relation to a welfare recipient\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what the law allows. It allows the correction of false information which has been placed in the media. Now in relation to Andie Fox there was false information that was placed into the media, which she herself penned. And so information was provided to correct the record in relation to those allegations.\u201d But Tudge was mistakenly quoting from legal guidelines that are only relevant if the Department of Human Services secretary formally authorises the release of personal information by issuing a public interest certificate. This would have required the secretary to take into account a range of factors and provide a written authorisation before releasing Fox\u2019s information. Tudge\u2019s own department has already said it did not issue such a certificate and released the information under another law. \u201cThey do not need to be formally authorised by the secretary,\u201d a spokeswoman said on Monday. The section of the guidelines Tudge was quoting from also only authorised the release of personal information from the secretary directly to the minister; not the public or media. That section of the guidelines states: \u201cRelevant information may be disclosed for the purpose of this section if the disclosure is necessary ... to brief a minister in relation to issues raised or proposed to be raised publicly by or on behalf of the person to whom the relevant information relates so that the minister can respond by correcting a mistake of fact, a misleading perception or impression, or a misleading statement\u201d. After Guardian Australia put questions to the minister about his comments in parliament, a departmental spokesman said: \u201cThe disclosure in relation to Ms Fox did not need to be made under a public interest certificate (PIC) and the PIC guidelines are not relevant. This is because the disclosure was for the purposes of the relevant law.\u201d The release of Fox\u2019s personal information has dominated debate in parliament while agencies have fronted up to given evidence at Senate estimates. Australia\u2019s information and privacy commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, told the Senate on Tuesday that his office had made preliminary inquiries of Centrelink about whether it had the legal authority to release the information. \u201cHaving seen a report that there were some concerns about how potentially sensitive information had been released, I thought it was necessary for us to make some inquiries to assess what powers Centrelink was using to release the personal information of an individual into the public arena,\u201d Pilgrim said. \u201cWe\u2019re making general inquiries. I would stress that this is not a formal investigation at this time but making inquiries to ascertain to release that information.\u201d Legal experts have expressed surprise at the decision to release Fox\u2019s information, describing it as against past practice. Legal Aid Victoria has also raised serious concern about the release, and said there were real doubts about the way the law had been interpreted. It has begun advising individuals that speaking out about their Centrelink debts means their personal details may be released. Civil justice executive director, Dan Nicholson, described it as an \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d situation. Nicholson called for the department to set out exactly what powers it had used to release the information. He said the disclosure of protected information was typically considered criminal, and could be punished by up to two years imprisonment. \u201cIn this case the government relies on an exception to the offence that allows disclosures because they are \u2018for the purposes of social security law\u2019 \u2013 specifically because, they claim, \u2018unfounded allegations necessarily undermine confidence and takes staff effort away from the dealing with other claims\u2019,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cThis is an extraordinarily broad interpretation of this exception. We can\u2019t find any decided cases that support it, and we think there are real doubts about this interpretation of the law,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems that Centrelink is attempting to get around important safeguards in the Act by releasing the information in the way they have.\u201d Australian National University academic and social security lawyer, Peter Sutherland, said the disclosure was unusual, and said its legality could only be properly tested in court. \u201cThis is an unusual extension of past practice in the field,\u201d Sutherland told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt may or may not be authorised by the section 202 of the social security (administration) act and s162 of the family assistance act,\u201d he said. \u201cBut really that\u2019s a matter for the courts to decide, it\u2019s not an open and shut case.\u201d The Australian Association of Social Workers described it as an \u201cabuse of power and not the way to engage with vulnerable people\u201d. Association president, Karen Healy, said pursuing budget savings through \u201cpolicies of fear and intimidation\u201d would only further entrench people in poverty. \u201cThe AASW and its members, professional social workers, know the damaging impact of intimidation on people with complex issues,\u201d Healy said. \u201cThe way to engage with people experiencing hardship and looking to their government for support is with empathy and compassion,\u201d she said.",

It applies to asylum seekers intercepted at sea and taken to Nauru or Manus, including those currently in Australia for medical treatment.</p> <p>The visa ban bill contravenes Australia\u2019s international human rights obligations. Refugee law experts, human rights advocates and even the Labor party, which reintroduced the use of detention centres on Nauru and Manus, argue the bill is inhumane, discriminatory and pointless.</p> <p>In a similar vein to Trump\u2019s executive order, this ban will <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/comment/instead-of-solving-a-problem-that-doesnt-exist-turnbull-must-address-the-one-that-does-20161107-gsjzlf.html\">separate families</a>.</p> <p> The only so-called safeguard is that the minister would have the power to overrule the visa ban in individual cases when he considers it is in \u201cthe public interest\u201d. Of course, a safeguard that relies on the whim of the decision-maker, with no independent oversight, is no safeguard at all.</p> <p>The second bill, currently before the Senate, is the <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5751\">Migration Amendment (Visa Revalidation and Other Measures) Bill 2016</a>. This bill allows the minister to personally issue a revalidation requirement for entire specified cohorts of visa holders, immediately preventing them from being able to enter Australia until their visa is revalidated.<strong> </strong>The power is not limited to any particular class of visa.</p> <p> This power may be exercised on the basis of defined criteria, such as health checks, but may also be exercised when the minister considers it is in \u201cthe public interest\u201d to do so. The unfettered, exceptionally broad power this gives the minister over any individual residing in Australia, who does not hold Australian citizenship, is alarming.</p> <p>These bills allow just one person \u2013 the immigration minister \u2013 to make substantial and permanent decisions about another person\u2019s life: whether a young woman will be sent back to the persecution from which she fled; whether a baby born in Australia to asylum seekers will be allowed to grow up with his or her parents; whether a person will have their visa cancelled without warning or opportunity to apply for its reinstatement. </p> <p>The minister\u2019s decision is virtually unreviewable unlike Trump\u2019s executive order which, we have seen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/09/judges-deny-trump-travel-ban-enforcement-uphold-order\">the courts can interrogate</a>. </p> <p> Liberty Victoria\u2019s Young Liberty for Law Reform has comprehensively reviewed the past 60 years of Australia\u2019s immigration laws and found a troubling increase in decision-making powers that include \u201cpublic interest\u201d as a condition for the exercise of a non-reviewable, non-compellable ministerial discretion.</p> <p>Public interest has been described by the courts as entirely discretionary and politically motivated. So, Dutton can decide whether to exercise his decision-making power <em>and</em> he defines what the public interest is. No checks. No balances. No accountability.</p> <p>The government argues that ministerial discretion is necessary in migration matters, and that it is often used in <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/national/investigations/is-lulus-english-good-enough-the-immigration-department-is-not-convinced-20161208-gt6vn2.html\">compassionate cases</a>. That does not mean that this power always achieves <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/11/16/south-african-family-ordered-leave-australia-christmas\">compassionate outcomes.</a></p> <p>While increasing the minister\u2019s powers, these two bills also sideline the checks and balances that keep our government accountable.</p> <p>Powers of this kind have long been criticised. As far back as 1989 the then-immigration minister, Robert Ray, attempted to remove all ministerial discretion from the Migration Act, stating: \u201cDecision-making guidelines are perceived to be obscure, arbitrarily changed and applied, and subject to day-to-day political intervention in individual cases.\u201d</p> <p>In 2004, a <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Former_Committees/minmig/report/index\">Senate inquiry</a> into ministerial discretion in migration recommended that these powers should be \u201ca last resort to deal with cases that a truly exceptional or unforeseeable.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/27/liberal-senator-appears-to-describe-asylum-seekers-as-fleas-in-senate-estimates\">Liberal senator appears to describe asylum seekers as 'fleas' in Senate estimates</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The committee found the minister\u2019s ability to \u201cmicro-manage\u201d the immigration system concerning, given it \u201ccreates the possibility and perception of corruption.\u201d And in 2008 then-immigration minister Chris Evans stated he was uncomfortable with the unprecedented power given to the immigration minister because these powers lack transparency, accountability, appeal rights and allowed him to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/Estimates/Live/commttee/S10636.ashx\">play God</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Discretionary ministerial powers were originally established to prevent injustice. They were a tool to fix anomalies, a safety net reserved for extraordinary cases, and a power to override the missteps of a blind bureaucracy.</p> <p>These bills increase Dutton\u2019s ability to make life or death decisions. They allow him to decide which families get to be together and which don\u2019t. They do all of this while simultaneously eroding the safeguards that were designed to protect fair decision-making.</p> <p>The minister must not be allowed to play God.</p> <p><em>Elizabeth Colliver, Shawn Rajanayagam and Lauren Bull are members of Young Liberty for Law Reform, a project of Liberty Victoria.</em></p>",

The first is the \u201cvisa ban bill\u201d, formally the Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing Cohort) Bill 2016 \u2013 a proposed law that would prevent any adult taken to Nauru or Manus Island after 19 July 2013 from ever making a valid Australian visa application. It applies to asylum seekers intercepted at sea and taken to Nauru or Manus, including those currently in Australia for medical treatment. The visa ban bill contravenes Australia\u2019s international human rights obligations. Refugee law experts, human rights advocates and even the Labor party, which reintroduced the use of detention centres on Nauru and Manus, argue the bill is inhumane, discriminatory and pointless. In a similar vein to Trump\u2019s executive order, this ban will separate families. The only so-called safeguard is that the minister would have the power to overrule the visa ban in individual cases when he considers it is in \u201cthe public interest\u201d. Of course, a safeguard that relies on the whim of the decision-maker, with no independent oversight, is no safeguard at all. The second bill, currently before the Senate, is the Migration Amendment (Visa Revalidation and Other Measures) Bill 2016. This bill allows the minister to personally issue a revalidation requirement for entire specified cohorts of visa holders, immediately preventing them from being able to enter Australia until their visa is revalidated. The power is not limited to any particular class of visa. This power may be exercised on the basis of defined criteria, such as health checks, but may also be exercised when the minister considers it is in \u201cthe public interest\u201d to do so. The unfettered, exceptionally broad power this gives the minister over any individual residing in Australia, who does not hold Australian citizenship, is alarming. These bills allow just one person \u2013 the immigration minister \u2013 to make substantial and permanent decisions about another person\u2019s life: whether a young woman will be sent back to the persecution from which she fled; whether a baby born in Australia to asylum seekers will be allowed to grow up with his or her parents; whether a person will have their visa cancelled without warning or opportunity to apply for its reinstatement. The minister\u2019s decision is virtually unreviewable unlike Trump\u2019s executive order which, we have seen, the courts can interrogate. Liberty Victoria\u2019s Young Liberty for Law Reform has comprehensively reviewed the past 60 years of Australia\u2019s immigration laws and found a troubling increase in decision-making powers that include \u201cpublic interest\u201d as a condition for the exercise of a non-reviewable, non-compellable ministerial discretion. Public interest has been described by the courts as entirely discretionary and politically motivated. So, Dutton can decide whether to exercise his decision-making power and he defines what the public interest is. No checks. No balances. No accountability. The government argues that ministerial discretion is necessary in migration matters, and that it is often used in compassionate cases. That does not mean that this power always achieves compassionate outcomes. While increasing the minister\u2019s powers, these two bills also sideline the checks and balances that keep our government accountable. Powers of this kind have long been criticised. As far back as 1989 the then-immigration minister, Robert Ray, attempted to remove all ministerial discretion from the Migration Act, stating: \u201cDecision-making guidelines are perceived to be obscure, arbitrarily changed and applied, and subject to day-to-day political intervention in individual cases.\u201d In 2004, a Senate inquiry into ministerial discretion in migration recommended that these powers should be \u201ca last resort to deal with cases that a truly exceptional or unforeseeable.\u201d The committee found the minister\u2019s ability to \u201cmicro-manage\u201d the immigration system concerning, given it \u201ccreates the possibility and perception of corruption.\u201d And in 2008 then-immigration minister Chris Evans stated he was uncomfortable with the unprecedented power given to the immigration minister because these powers lack transparency, accountability, appeal rights and allowed him to \u201cplay God.\u201d Discretionary ministerial powers were originally established to prevent injustice. They were a tool to fix anomalies, a safety net reserved for extraordinary cases, and a power to override the missteps of a blind bureaucracy. These bills increase Dutton\u2019s ability to make life or death decisions. They allow him to decide which families get to be together and which don\u2019t. They do all of this while simultaneously eroding the safeguards that were designed to protect fair decision-making. The minister must not be allowed to play God.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s economy has rebounded, recording 1.1% growth in the December 2016 quarter. The result reverses the shock negative result in the September quarter and means Australia has avoided a recession, as was widely projected by market economists. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday show Australia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has now grown 2.4% through the year, below the long-term average of about 2.75%. Despite the high 1.1% seasonally adjusted growth figure, trend growth in the quarter was 0.3% and the trend annual growth was just 1.9%. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the result was achieved due to strong household consumption, but warned that \u201cweak wages growth\u201d was still weighing the economy and budget revenue down. Australia has now recorded 101 quarters between the June 1991 and the 2016 December quarter without two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. Australia continues to close in on the Netherlands\u2019 record of 103 quarters without a recession, which Deloitte Access Economics has predicted it will surpass this year. The ABS found that household final consumption expenditure contributed 0.5% to GDP growth and net exports a further 0.2%. Public and private capital formation contributed 0.3% this quarter after both detracted from GDP growth last quarter. The terms of trade grew by 9.1% in the December quarter due to strong price rises in coal and iron ore. The terms of trade are now 15.6% higher than the December quarter of 2015. In the September quarter Australia\u2019s gross domestic product contracted by 0.5%, the first negative quarter in five years. Responding to the improved results, treasurer Scott Morrison lauded the fact Australia is growing faster than every G7 economy and the OECD average. \u201c[The result] confirms the successful change that is taking place in our economy as we move from the largest resources investment boom in our history to broader-based growth,\u201d he said. Morrison noted it was the \u201cfirst time ... for a while\u201d that final-state demand for all states and territories had grown in the December quarter. The treasurer said the principle driver for growth was \u201ca solid rebound in household consumption\u201d which occurred \u201cdespite subdued wages growth\u201d. \u201cOf concern in these accounts is that compensation of employees in the quarter declined by 0.5%. It was up 1.5% in the year.\u201d Morrison said that the combination of better prices and higher trade volumes had \u201ca significant impact on company profits, especially in the resource sector\u201d. \u201cHowever, I caution it would be wrong ... to assume that those gains have been experienced evenly across all businesses in the economy.\u201d The chief Australian economist for Capital Economics, Paul Dales, warned that despite the result \u201ceconomic growth will probably still disappoint this year\u201d. \u201cIn the second half of last year the economy grew by just 0.6% and we know that the collapse in mining investment has further to go,\u201d he said. Dales warned that recent falls in building approval meant dwelling investment may soon fall and record low wage growth would lower household spending. \u201cIn other words, the boost to national income from higher commodity prices will mostly boost profits rather than activity.\u201d Shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the GDP result was welcome and an expected bounce after \u201cthe horrible negative quarter last year\u201d. Bowen said stronger household consumption was \u201clargely attributable to people drawing down heavily on their savings instead of any boost to their wages which are growing at generation lows\u201d. \u201cThe national accounts show that corporate profits surged while wages and salaries in the economy fell in December,\u201d he said, noting that penalty rates had just been cut by the Fair Work Commission for 700,000 workers. Before the release of the figures on Wednesday, the Treasury secretary, John Fraser, told Senate estimates the September result showed the \u201ceconomy remains sensitive to shocks\u201d. \u201cThere were some factors likely to be of a one-off nature such as the weather related disruptions in the construction sector. \u201cHowever that there is no denying that it was a very weak quarter.\u201d Fraser said he did not believe the result represents the \u201cunderlying pulse\u201d of the economy and treasury and market economists expected it to rebound. He said in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook Treasury projected 2.75% growth in 2017-18.",
