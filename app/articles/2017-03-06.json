The stone outlines are believed to have been created by local Yolngu elders towards the end of the 19th century to illustrate the wooden \u201cprau\u201d boats the visitors would arrive on and stone fireplaces used to boil sea cucumber.

As a township bloomed, it opened up the central desert region to European settlement and changed the lives of the local Arrernta people forever.<br /></p> <p>The site is now 4km out of town and is a good place to get a feel for what those early colonial days were like. It\u2019s also a good spot to learn about the real-life Alice Todd, the wife of Sir Charles Todd, the superintendent of telegraphs, after whom Alice Springs was named. Among the restored stone buildings are barracks, a post and telegraph office that once operated using morse code, and the station master\u2019s residence.

Whether the missionaries were successful or should be congratulated for their ambition to convert local Arrernta people to both Christian beliefs and western lifestyles depends on who you talk to.</p> <p>Despite its sometimes muddled signage, this remains a compelling place: as you wander aboutthere\u2019s a sense that ghosts from the past, including many Arrernta men, women and children and the smaller number of German pastors and their families who once called this place home, continue to linger in the well-preserved church, classrooms, workrooms and living quarters. One of the buildings also exhibits work by the community\u2019s most famous artist, the landscape water colourist Albert Namatjira, and you can visit his humble whitewashed house by driving 5km west of Hermannsburg.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"http://hermannsburg.com.au/\">Hermannsburg Historic Precinct</a> is at 47 Raberaba Circuit, Hermannsburg, (08) 8956 7402.

The 50th anniversary of the walk-off in the tiny settlement of Kalkarindji also featured the opening of a walking track with new heritage signage housed in steel and iron pavilions designed by the University of Melbourne\u2019s award-winning Bower Studio. You can visit the hand-back memorial, an art centre called Karungkarni Art housing memorabilia, historical photographs and archival films, and the town cemetery where Lingiari is buried. \u2022 Karungkarni Art is at Lot 77, Buntine Highway, Kalkarindji, 0427 177 779. If you would like to visit, you must call ahead to arrange an appointment. Free admission Alice Springs Telegraph Station Back in 1872, there was no town called Alice Springs, just a repeater station on the overland telegraph line that ran the 3,200km between Darwin and Port Augusta in South Australia. As a township bloomed, it opened up the central desert region to European settlement and changed the lives of the local Arrernta people forever. The site is now 4km out of town and is a good place to get a feel for what those early colonial days were like. It\u2019s also a good spot to learn about the real-life Alice Todd, the wife of Sir Charles Todd, the superintendent of telegraphs, after whom Alice Springs was named. Among the restored stone buildings are barracks, a post and telegraph office that once operated using morse code, and the station master\u2019s residence. Hire a bicycle from Outback Cycling if you want to explore nearby bush tracks or walk the trail to a great vantage point for sunrise or sunset. \u2022 Alice Springs Telegraph Station is on Herbert Heritage Drive, Stuart, (08) 8952 3993. Admission fees are $5 to $13.75; free for children under six Hermannsburg Historic Precinct The Hermannsburg Historic Precinct is an odd but fascinating village of buildings telling the story of a motley crew of Lutheran missionaries who travelled from Germany to set up a church in the middle of the Australian desert. Whether the missionaries were successful or should be congratulated for their ambition to convert local Arrernta people to both Christian beliefs and western lifestyles depends on who you talk to. Despite its sometimes muddled signage, this remains a compelling place: as you wander aboutthere\u2019s a sense that ghosts from the past, including many Arrernta men, women and children and the smaller number of German pastors and their families who once called this place home, continue to linger in the well-preserved church, classrooms, workrooms and living quarters. One of the buildings also exhibits work by the community\u2019s most famous artist, the landscape water colourist Albert Namatjira, and you can visit his humble whitewashed house by driving 5km west of Hermannsburg. \u2022 Hermannsburg Historic Precinct is at 47 Raberaba Circuit, Hermannsburg, (08) 8956 7402. Admission fees are $11 for adults, $9 for concession card holders; free for children",

Just as Fair Trade and organic branding initiatives have convinced consumers to pay a higher price for products and services that might not be produced in the most coldly efficient way possible, businesses are realising the potential to carve out a niche in the face of growing disenchantment with the rise of the machines. Marketers have identified a range of branding benefits to retaining human talent in the face of cheaper and more efficient automated alternatives \u2013 from the ethical glow of providing employment for communities to the customer relationship-building potential of human interaction. In Australia, as the major supermarket duopoly of Coles and Woolworths continues to expand self-service checkout lanes (despite losing millions of dollars in stolen products), some competitors are choosing to go the other way. The small South Australian chain Adelaide\u2019s Finest Supermarket, operator of a pair of Foodland supermarkets, has loudly and publicly banned self-service checkouts in an attempt to attract customers sick of being told to have a nice day by a robotic voice emanating from speakers. An Australian consumer behaviour analyst Barry Urquhart, managing director of Marketing Focus, says staffed checkout is also a key point of difference for Aldi and for much of the IGA chain of independent supermarkets. \u201cIGA always made virtue of doing things how the locals like it, and when you employ young people, it always strikes a chord,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is not driven purely by internal efficiency, but [by] showing good social conscience in conspicuously engaging young people, customers will notice, Branding is a matter of knowing what your values are, then you go out there and project that.\u201d Urquhart\u2019s market research findings have him convinced that major companies have erred in stacking their boards with finance-sector types fixated on saving money. \u201cLowering costs comes at a cost \u2013 in many instances the relationship with existing customers becomes very transactional,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no ongoing relationship, it is reactional and consumers become hyper-price sensitive, lacking loyalty and repeat business \u2013 you have to keep winning them back. \u201cWhen you have technology replacing humanity, it is best deployed when it complements, not replaces people.

The brand futurist Martin Lindstrom, author of Buyology: The Truth, points to the US supermarket chain client Lowes as an example of a company restructuring to include more staff trained to provide \u201ctrue experiences\u201d in-store. \u201cSure the cost went up \u2013 but suddenly the guests felt someone cared about them,\u201d he says. Just because a company brands itself as human, however, doesn\u2019t mean it is necessarily employing more people: Lowes is cutting back-of-house staff as it restructures and is experimenting with customer service bots \u2013 it is just that they aren\u2019t marketing themselves on their technology. \u201cAs we\u2019re increasingly becoming more and more technology-obsessed, many business leaders have come to the false conclusion that technology should lead their brands,\u201d Lindstrom says. \u201cNothing couldn\u2019t be further from the truth \u2013 the role of technology should be to amplify the human dimensions.\u201d The pushback against automation is being fanned by marketing research conducted by customer analytics firm Verint Digital, which last October released its Tipping Point report, polling more than 24,000 consumers in 12 countries.

She points to last year\u2019s Swedish Tourist Association campaign that allowed anyone in the world to call \u201cThe Swedish Number\u201d and speak to a random Swedish citizen. \u201cBy enabling ordinary citizens to speak openly and honestly about their country, The Swedish Number reveals more about the culture and history of Sweden and the attitudes and interests of its citizens than any polished campaign could,\u201d she says.

The report finds that 2016-17 is set to be a bumper year for agriculture mostly off the back of exceptional growing conditions. It\u2019s a report that highlights the importance of the right environment for agricultural production and also how susceptible agriculture is to the impact of climate change. One of the more unusual aspects of last week\u2019s GDP figures was that the leader of the pack over the past year has not been the mining industry. For the first time since September 2008, and for only the fourth time in the past 20 years, the agricultural industry was the biggest contributor to annual GDP growth: The reality is it has been a very long time since Australia has ridden on the sheep\u2019s back (or on top of a silo full of wheat). Over the past 40 years, the agriculture and forestry industry has contributed just 2% of Australia\u2019s GDP growth \u2013 the third lowest of any industry. That does not mean the industry is unimportant, but perhaps it does show how we do view the industry through an historical and cultural lens that we don\u2019t, for example, with the accommodation and food services industry, despite the two industries contributing a similar level of value added into the economy. The agricultural industry however remains a good representation of the Australian economy to the extent that it remains captive to world prices, the value of the Australian dollar and the vicissitudes of weather and climate.

As the deputy prime minister and minister for agriculture and water resources, Barnaby Joyce told parliament last week, we now have record beef and sheep prices, and wool is at a price not seen since the 1980s. Prices for wheat and barley, however fell: The impact of the Australian dollar is crucial in agricultural exports. Abares notes that the depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar from 2013 increased the competitiveness of Australian exports \u2013 because most rural commodities are bought and sold in US dollars. The RBA\u2019s index of commodity price shows that while rural prices have fallen since 2011, the falling value of our dollar meant the prices in Australian dollar terms actually held up: In effect farmers were getting more Australian dollars for their produce, even while they were getting less in US dollar terms. Abares notes that the total real value of Australian agricultural exports increased for seven consecutive years from 2008\u201309 to 2014\u201315. They attribute this growth to the global demand for food, particularly from Asian countries, that has seen an increase in our exports to Asia and also to productivity growth among farm production. On this score it is worth noting that over the past 20 years, only the wholesale trade industry has seen greater improvements in productivity than the agriculture industry: Farming in 1997 is akin to the dark ages compared to how it is done now with much more efficient equipment and methods.

      "bodyText": "First established in 1996 and occurring every five years, the State of the Environment report is prepared by independent authors and provides a report card across nine thematic areas \u2013 the Antarctic environment, atmosphere, biodiversity, built environment, coasts, heritage, inland waters, land and the marine environment. The report will this year for the first time be available in an interactive digital format, expanding its reach and ensuring greater use and engagement from the academic and broader community. Like previous reports, this year\u2019s document has its bright spots while also indicating a number of areas where there is much more to do. Good progress has been made in the management of the marine and Antarctic environments, natural and cultural heritage and the built environment, while pressures are building in relation to invasive species, climate change, land use and coastal protection. The number of people in Australia has doubled over the past 50 years. Growing urbanisation (two-thirds of the population live in our capital cities and 90% of people live in 0.22% of Australia\u2019s land area) and heightened economic activity (Australia is experiencing its 26th year of consecutive economic growth) have combined to contribute to additional pressures on the environment. The message, however, is not that development and sustainability are locked in a zero-sum game. Far from it. Rather, we must be conscious of these pressures, prepare for them and put in place a coordinated, comprehensive, well-resourced long-term response. Failure to do so will have a direct and detrimental impact on our quality of life and leave a legacy to future generations that is inferior to the one we have inherited. This is why reports such as this are important and why we must continue to upgrade our capacity to collect and analyse critical environmental data. It\u2019s also why last November I committed \u2013 along with state and territory environment ministers \u2013 to develop more detailed environmental accounts for Australia to build this capacity to better understand our environment and how best to protect it. The report indicates that the Antarctic is in \u201cgenerally good condition\u201d, with evidence that the phasing out of powerful synthetic greenhouse gases, in which Australia has played a lead role under the Montreal protocol, is leading to improvements in the ozone layer. Macquarie Island, which has seen rabbits and rats in plague proportions, is also recovering well following a successful invasive species eradication policy. Invasive species more generally are a growing problem. We are all familiar with the devastation that has been unleashed across our continent by the arrival of cane toads, feral pigs and yellow crazy ants. But feral cats should top this list because their population growth and diet of marsupials, birds and reptiles make them one of the biggest threats to a number of nationally listed species. The good news is that the federal government has acted in implementing a new threatened species strategy and appointing the first threatened species commissioner. However, there is a big task ahead with the addition of 44 animal and five plant species to the threatened species list, meaning there are now 545 animal and 1,312 plant species under threat. One notable mention in the report was that humpback whales are increasing in number to a point where their current listing as \u201cvulnerable\u201d may need to be reconsidered. Australia\u2019s 108 national and 19 world heritage sites are admired both here and abroad and are integral to our cultural history and values. They remain, according to the report, \u201cgenerally in good condition\u201d, but the Great Barrier Reef last year was subject to a significant bleaching event, with climate change and the El Ni\u00f1o effect to blame. Conscious of the threat to this natural wonder of the world, the federal government is jointly investing with the Queensland government $2bn to support our Reef 2050 plan to improve water quality and preserve the health of the reef. Australia has a strong reputation in management of its national reserve system. Since 2011, the Ningaloo Reef has been added and extensions made to the Tasmanian wilderness and Kakadu properties on the World Heritage List. Since 2012, 12 new places have been added to the National Heritage List, including the Snowy Mountains scheme in New South Wales and Lesueur national park in Western Australia, ensuring that our historic places are preserved for future generations. The report indicates that the impact of changing weather patterns is affecting biodiversity and species habitat. While carbon emissions per capita have declined from 24.1 tonnes in 2011 to 22.2 tonnes in 2015, and energy efficiency improvements are reducing electricity demand, the report makes clear that, for the world to meet its Paris goals, there is much more to do. Land clearing also comes in for attention in the report. With the exception of Queensland, land clearing rates over the past five years \u201chave stabilised in all states and territories\u201d and Indigenous protected areas have substantially increased. Since 2008 there have been an additional 42 agreements and 20.6m hectares which are now covered under the Indigenous protected areas. The national reserve system, protecting important natural assets, has expanded to cover 17.9% of Australia\u2019s land are, compared with 13.4% in 2011. These are all significant improvements which are felt right across the environmental food chain as pollination, seed disposal and species\u2019 survival rely on an ecosystem where vegetation and habitat are protected. Despite the growth in urban population, air and urban water quality remain \u201cgood\u201d according to the report, with \u201cnoticeable local improvements in water quality in the Murray Darling basin\u201d. Sustainable diversion limits and water efficiency are having a positive impact on the fish and water bird stocks as well as natural vegetation. There is no room for complacency. Regardless of one\u2019s political persuasion, we all have a vested interest in protecting our commons. The Coalition track record in this regard is strong. The Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, like the Natural Heritage Trust and the first mandatory renewable energy target, were all initiatives of the Howard government. The 10-year Murray-Darling basin plan was implemented by Malcolm Turnbull. Former prime ministers Tony Abbott, Malcolm Fraser, William McMahon, John Gorton, Harold Holt and Robert Menzies all too had significant achievements to their name. The task now is to build on this proud Coalition tradition and to use this report to continue the good work the government is doing across so many areas of environmental policy.

The review also requires an examination of international developments in climate change policy, which is code for an assessment of what is happening on global climate action in the event the US pulls out of the Paris climate agreement. The New York Times reported last week that the White House was fiercely divided over Trump\u2019s campaign promise to cancel the Paris agreement.

As well as underscoring a lack of voter enthusiasm about the leadership of Australia\u2019s major political parties, the new poll highlights the Turnbull government\u2019s acute political difficulties in the wake of the Fair Work Commission\u2019s decision to cut Sunday penalty rates for hospitality and retail workers. The survey shows 56% of respondents disapproved of the penalty rates cut, and 57% of the survey said they believed the most likely result of the change will be bigger profits for business, not more jobs in retail and hospitality. Only 24% of people think the cut will result in business employing more workers, which was one of the FWC\u2019s stated rationales in making the decision. Fifty-one per cent of those surveyed now want the Turnbull government to intervene and pass legislation protecting penalty rates. Labor and the Greens have flagged corrective legislation in the wake of the ruling, but the government has argued the FWC is an independent tribunal, and its decisions need to be respected.

Essential also asked survey participants about a five-point conservative manifesto Abbott launched late in February. The former prime minister used an incendiary speech at a book launch in Sydney to declare the Coalition needs to cut immigration to improve housing affordability, slash the renewable energy target, abolish the Human Rights Commission, and gut the capacity of the Senate to be a roadblock to the government\u2019s agenda. Abbott argued the Coalition risked drifting to electoral defeat, and radical action was needed to woo back disaffected conservatives from their current flirtation with other political movements, including One Nation. The most clearly popular proposition in the Abbott manifesto was his proposal to cut immigration on the basis it would make housing more affordable. Fifty-seven per cent of voters agreed with that proposition. Turnbull was asked on radio in Melbourne on Monday, in the context of a discussion about rising housing prices, whether he would consider reducing immigration to relieve \u201cpopulation pressure\u201d.

But out of nowhere this odd surface in Bangalore calmed down, Australia\u2019s intensity wained and the finest partnership of the series so far ensued. An unbroken 93-run stand between Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane has dragged India from a perilous state of effectively 33/4 and guided them to a lead approaching favouritism.</p> <p>It was hard to imagine such an outcome at the start of a day that began with a flurry of Australian wickets, nor heading to the tea interval when both Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja had recently perished.

Less settled in this line-up is Abhinav Mukund, who hasn\u2019t played a Test in six years and looks a bit rusty when he fences outside off stump to Starc first up. The Aussie laughs, then literally licks his lips. </p> <p>Mukund gets off strike thanks to a bye when a huge but innocuous deviation off a crack sends the ball darting past Matthew Wade. Starc has an enthusiastic LBW shout against Rahul but there\u2019s a thick inside edge and Nigel Llong is having none of it. That swung appreciably, but Starc errs next up by putting another on Rahul\u2019s hip; this time he makes solid contact to send it crashing to the fence at fine leg. Money for jam.

Russell Jackson here to take you through the first couple of sessions on what will prove the pivotal day in deciding the result. In actual fact, I have a feeling that 45 minutes of big hitting by Mitchell Starc could put India out of the game and with it, the series. If you disagree, please do hit me with an apoplectic email or tweet.</p> <p>Australia hold a 48-run lead at present. Push that past 140ish and it\u2019ll be very hard for the home side, though this pitch will be an absolute nightmare to bat on by the fourth innings and by then Australia might well have a chase on their hands. Resuming with Starc is Matthew Wade, who compiled a useful 25 not out last night, and is a born scrapper. I don\u2019t know about you, but I can\u2019t wait to settle in for another day of this fascinating series. Yesterday was nirvana for lovers of tense, attritional Test cricket.

But out of nowhere this odd surface in Bangalore calmed down, Australia\u2019s intensity wained and the finest partnership of the series so far ensued. An unbroken 93-run stand between Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane has dragged India from a perilous state of effectively 33/4 and guided them to a lead approaching favouritism. It was hard to imagine such an outcome at the start of a day that began with a flurry of Australian wickets, nor heading to the tea interval when both Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja had recently perished. But this latest chapter adds another layer of intrigue to an engrossing Test match that seems set to deliver a grandstand finish. Join us back here for day four, for who knows what? 72nd over: India 213-4 (Pujara 79, Rahane 40) Starc to bowl the final over of the day and he almost makes it a short one, Pujara edging his first delivery but it flies wide of the solitary slip Smith. In response, Smith brings Handscomb into second slip, under a lid, and about five metres closer to the stumps than Wade. Pujara survives, finds a single from the penultimate delivery to secure his appearance at the crease tomorrow. Rahane dabs the final ball safely into the offside, high-fives his batting partner and leaves the field to warm applause. 71st over: India 208-4 (Pujara 74, Rahane 40) Terrific umpiring as India try to minimise the number of remaining overs with a drink and physio break but India\u2019s support staff don\u2019t reach the square before they\u2019re told to hop it. Now both the striker and non-striker are trying to delay O\u2019Keefe. And while Rahane\u2019s so focussed on playing out time he almost chases a lovely delivery into Wade\u2019s gloves. A maiden is dotted out. One over left. 70th over: India 208-4 (Pujara 74, Rahane 40) Mitchell Starc is recalled in a bold late move by Steve Smith. He\u2019s looking for fast reverse swinging yorkers, hurling down javelins to Rahane\u2019s toenails. One after another, like he\u2019s trying to nail the batsmen to the ground. This is an excellent effort late in the day by the big fast bowler, but Rahane survives and even farms the strike with a single from the final delivery. 69th over: India 207-4 (Pujara 74, Rahane 39) Pujara is delivering a masterclass out there for India. Solid in defence, watchful, but still alert to scoring opportunities. A stellar innings in this match and series. What else can Australia do? 68th over: India 205-4 (Pujara 72, Rahane 39) Lyon\u2019s come out of nowhere to start making things happen again. Two overs in a row with more turn and bounce but with two set batsmen nearing the close of play they\u2019re avoiding the pitfalls of previous sessions. India reach 200 for the first time this series. Four byes sends the lead to 118 and nearing dangerous territory for Australia. 67th over: India 198-4 (Pujara 70, Rahane 38) Australia rattling through the overs now as play draws to a close. O\u2019Keefe beats Rahane\u2019s forward prod but again there\u2019s no edge. Replays of Pujara\u2019s discomfort from Lyon\u2019s bowling in the previous over does reveal a glove to one of those deliveries that spat at him, so a catch was on offer had a fielder been stationed in the right place. 66th over: India 198-4 (Pujara 70, Rahane 38) The first delivery to take off in ages rears at Pujara from Lyon - and another immediately afterwards! The luck is with India though and there\u2019s no gloved chance to a close catcher. Better for Australia, who have gone from chirping in the field to some positively village geeing-up. 65th over: India 198-4 (Pujara 70, Rahane 38) Rahane\u2019s playing with fire to O\u2019Keefe, padding up outside off-stump but despite the appeal O\u2019Keefe concedes it probably didn\u2019t do enough to warrant a review. Rahane blocks that aberration from his mind and plays a wristy flick in front of square, deep in his crease, for a classy boundary. India\u2019s lead now 111, this partnership worth 78. 64th over: India 194-4 (Pujara 70, Rahane 34) Under half an hour remaining of play as this partnership, unbroken for the final session, seems set to be the decisive factor in another gripping day of Test cricket. Lyon continues to plug away, but this is no longer on his terms. 63rd over: India 192-4 (Pujara 69, Rahane 33) Another over from O\u2019Keefe seen off without much fanfare. Some local knowledge from Anod, perhaps? \u201cThe third session on the third day and fourth day morning session are best for batting at Bangalore. Honest. Honest. Warm regards, Amod Paranjape.\u201d 62nd over: India 191-4 (Pujara 68, Rahane 33) India\u2019s lead stretches beyond 100 as Lyon spends an over with his hands on his head. This pair are playing so well form deep in their crease Lyon\u2019s prodigious turn is not bothering them and anything loose is being scored off. Robert Wilson joins in. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see that everyone is enjoying this cracking match. May I just say that this sportingly carnivorous pitch is very much a part of its charms. Quicks have to show some mettle, spinners have to control it and the batsmen have to globally man up. Every run is precious, skill and will can make a difference. No need for congressional oversight or anything, Cricket is meant to be hard.\u201d Hear hear. But then I was born in Yorkshire, so... 61st over: India 186-4 (Pujara 63, Rahane 33) O\u2019Keefe to make it spin from both ends and the left-armer gets a little bit more out of the surface but not enough to disturb what is now the highest partnership in the match. 60th over: India 183-4 (Pujara 60, Rahane 33) Whereas earlier in the day KL Rahul was farming the strike to see off Lyon, now both batsmen are looking to score off Australia\u2019s premier spinner. The spite in this surface has evaporated. The odd one is keeping low and the odd one is still spitting but nowhere near the extent we\u2019d become accustomed to. 59th over: India 180-4 (Pujara 59, Rahane 31) Rahane into his stride now, driving gloriously against Hazlewood but a superb stop by Shaun Marsh in the covers denies what would have been a textbook cover drive four. He does pick up two with a patient cut later in the over. Australia need something out of nowhere to break this partnership as the lead reaches 93. 58th over: India 178-4 (Pujara 59, Rahane 29) Rahane\u2019s confidence starting to flood back, despite his demotion down the order. A half-volley on off-stump is swept hard for four. Strong wrists, risky shot, but another indication of how this pitch has changed its behaviour since tea. This is not the crazy paving we\u2019ve seen in previous sessions. To prove the point Rahane dances down the track and drives ambitiously through the off-side. The sort of shot nobody would have dared to attempt on previous days. 57th over: India 171-4 (Pujara 59, Rahane 22) Hazlewood also recalled to the attack and he\u2019s greeted by a deft late cut from Pujara to guide a four down to fine third-man. Two more with a confident push to the cover sweeper is followed by another two, cut behind point. That brings up the 50 partnership, a cheer from the crowd and an acceptance that this pair are digging India out of a massive hole. Talking of massive holes, Hazlewood\u2019s fifth delivery looks to bury itself in one but Pujara is watchful, sees the grubber early and gets his bat down in time. India now lead by 84. 56th over: India 163-4 (Pujara 51, Rahane 22) Lyon returns to the attack after drinks and his drift is evident immediately but without the prodigious turn and bounce of the first innings Rahane is able to play him from the crease off the back foot into the offside. Can anyone add to this from Ian Forth? \u201cBeen trying to think of whose bowling Mitch Marsh reminds me of. Going back a bit, but there\u2019s a touch of the Bob Woolmer about him.\u201d A quick search fails to find Bob Woolmer in action, but here is coaching bowling, which is probably more fun. 55th over: India 159-4 (Pujara 50, Rahane 19) 50 for Pujara, just the fifth of the match, and it\u2019s been a vital calming knock, keeping India ticking over despite the drama at the other end before tea. Mitch Marsh is plugging away but the ball has stopped talking for Australia. They\u2019ll hope for a change of fortunes after drinks. 54th over: India 157-4 (Pujara 49, Rahane 18) More action from O\u2019Keefe at the start of his over. One beats Pujara\u2019s outside edge and then one looks to beat him on the inside prompting a vocal appeal but there was a big edge on closer inspection. 53rd over: India 156-4 (Pujara 48, Rahane 18) Marsh plugging away as you\u2019d expect but this pitch has gone into its shell a little. Whether it\u2019s the older ball, more accomplished batting, or what, it\u2019s hard to say, but this game has entered an unlikely phase this evening compared to what went before. 52nd over: India 155-4 (Pujara 47, Rahane 18) O\u2019Keefe not getting much turn from around the wicket, making the dangerous delivery, the straighter one, less of a variety. Another over comfortably seen off. 51st over: India 153-4 (Pujara 45, Rahane 18) Hold your horses! What\u2019s this? It\u2019s the lesser spotted Mitch Marsh to trundle in for just his third over of the series. You\u2019d fancy him on this surface, bowling those heavy stump-to-stump quicker-than-you-expect seamers. If there is uneven bounce, his line and high action should exploit them. And he gets one fourth delivery, that prompts an appeal but it\u2019s just angling past leg stump. Otherwise, pretty uneventful, as much of this final session has been, thanks to a very solid, watchful partnership. \u201cMitchell Marsh is a big sweater,\u201d says Michael Clarke as the bowler aborts a delivery to pick up the palm-blotting towel that had escaped from its bum-crack moorings. 50th over: India 153-4 (Pujara 45, Rahane 18) Smith packs his off-side field for O\u2019Keefe, trying to repeat Rahane\u2019s Pune dismissal but India\u2019s number six is reaching the pitch of the ball comfortably and sees out a maiden. 49th over: India 153-4 (Pujara 45, Rahane 18) Starc has yet to find his groove since he came on, his line outside off from around the wicket being left alone and anything straight worked with the angle to leg for runs. Partnership now worth 33, India\u2019s lead creeping up to 66. 48th over: India 149-4 (Pujara 44, Rahane 15) Double change with Steve O\u2019Keefe replacing Nathan Lyon. The first Test superstar has found a decent partnership blossoming for India, both right-handers judging length and turn beautifully since tea. Not much doing for SOK. Peter Salmon is invoking Corporal Jones on the email to try and capture the magnitude of this brilliant Test match. \u201cSo as things stand, either Australia runs through the tail and knocks off an easy 100 to win. Or they don\u2019t and have to chase a difficult 120-150. Or one of these Indians plays one of the great innings of all time and Australia has to chase 200 which is impossible. Unless one of the Australians also plays one of the great innings of all time and chases it down. Or there could be a tie, under any of the above scenarios. BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK EVERYONE JUST HAS TO CALM DOWN!!!\u201d 47th over: India 148-4 (Pujara 43, Rahane 15) Sandeep has his wish... on comes Mitchell Starc for Hazlewood, and he is bowling from around the wicket, really wide with that slingy left-arm action of his. The sightscreen will need to be at extra-cover. A mixture of full and short doesn\u2019t overly concern either batsman although that lack of bounce looks as though it could bring about a wicket at any time. 46th over: India 146-4 (Pujara 42, Rahane 13) This pair looking increasingly adept at facing Lyon, Rahane now unfurling the sweep, although it\u2019s perhaps not the most advisable stroke considering the prodigious bounce Lyon can generate. One does turn sharply but stays low and there\u2019s an LBW shout. It would be hard to give it moved so far but replays show it was an umpire\u2019s call on DRS. Blimey, who\u2019d be an umpire? Sandeep is perhaps a bit quick with his assessment by email, but I share the sentiment. \u201cLyon is hardly troubling the batsmen and Smith is letting the game slip here. I thought Mitch Marsh would be more than a handful on this wicket but he hasn\u2019t had a bowl! Other option is to get Starc in from around the wicket for some magic to happen.. it needs to happen soon or the game will be gone.\u201d 45th over: India 145-4 (Pujara 42, Rahane 13) Excellent from Rahane. Despite the pressure of the situation he\u2019s still able to cut a rare Hazlewood loosener to the point boundary. You can see what Hazlewood\u2019s trying to do though, find a length just shorter than normal for the shooter - and he hits the spot with his fifth delivery - but an unplayable rolling boulder is outside the off stump and no threat to Pujara. India\u2019s lead now 58. 44th over: India 140-4 (Pujara 42, Rahane 8) This pair are using their feet well to Lyon, smothering most of the grenades by stepping forward and then defusing the ones that spit by being so deep in their crease they have time to play them with soft hands. 43rd over: India 137-4 (Pujara 41, Rahane 6) And just for pure comedy value Hazlewood\u2019s opening two deliveries barely get above ankle height, the first of which provokes a stifled cry for LBW. This pitch is so unpredictable. Hazlewood wants to try out as many of its weak spots as he can, testing different shorter lengths searching for the unplayable pea-shooter. Rahane and Pujara are watchful though. 42nd over: India 134-4 (Pujara 40, Rahane 4) Pujara noticeably using his feet more against Lyon, especially to anything tossed up. The benefit of that is Lyon readjusting to a shorter length allowing the batsman to move back deep into his crease with plenty of time to whip runs on the on side. The last delivery of the over is reminiscent of the first innings, an unplayable jack in the box that Rahane does well just to get anything on. It flies just beyond David Warner\u2019s fingertips at leg slip and away to safety. That could easily have been another wicket. 41st over: India 131-4 (Pujara 38, Rahane 3) Hazlewood shares duties with Lyon and his radar is slightly askew in his first over after the break. A number of deliveries angled down the legside could have been punished but despite Pujara\u2019s intent the bowler escapes with just a couple of singles damage. This session yet to reach the same intensity of the previous two in what has been another engrossing day\u2019s play. 40th over: India 130-4 (Pujara 38, Rahane 2) Lyon to open proceedings after tea. 32 overs to be bowled in the session. Good start for India. Four byes followed by a driven four through the covers, Pujara using his feet to turn a length delivery into a full toss. Plenty of intent there from the Indian number three. Perhaps attack is his best form of defence? So, what is a dangerous total for Australia to chase? Anything over 100? 150? You wouldn\u2019t fancy chasing more on this shocker of a strip. Aniket has completed the Venn diagram of current affairs with this thought provoking email. \u201cThis test match ranks among the most exciting I have ever seen. Truly absorbing. There is an interesting analogy here. The general consensus here in India was that the Australians are going to be steamrolled and that they will be whitewashed, much like what Hillary Clinton, most of America and the the rest of the world thought that Trump will lose by a landslide. But as we can see, the tables have turned, and the Australians are playing magnificent cricket. Sadly, Trump has not been a magnificent president.\u201d Australia - The Deplorables. Well, well, well. This is already a modern classic of a Test match and hurtling at pace into a defining one for this young Australian outfit. Those two wickets just before tea have transformed this Test from an ominous one for the visitors with Kohli looking to assert himself into another that could be over inside three days. Much has come down to Steve Smith\u2019s captaincy, and as the old adage goes, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re good if you\u2019re lucky, and Smith\u2019s luck came in just at the right time courtesy of Hazlewood\u2019s golden arm. The major talking point from the two sessions so far and inevitably for the next week or so will be Kohli\u2019s LBW. He seemed convinced he hit the ball before it struck his pad, and he was an umpire\u2019s call outside the line of off-stump for good measure. Umpire Llong couldn\u2019t be wrong either way but his raised finger could prove to be diplomatic dynamite. You dare not blink during the next two hours of play. Test cricket, eh? India lead by 35 runs as my spell finishes, but JP Howcroft will be stopping by shortly to relieve me, and he\u2019s a master of reverse swing. Do make him welcome. 39th over: India 122-4 (Pujara 34, Rahane 2) And that is tea on day three. What a finish to the session by Australia\u2019s Josh Hazlewood. He\u2019s got 3-37 from 11 overs as he leads his side off, and they\u2019re right in this game. Ajinkya Rahane was dropped down the order \u2013 which didn\u2019t work when Ravi Jadeja was nipped out for 2 \u2013 and endured a minor nightmare in this over. The first ball he faced from Hazlewood spat up off the pitch to rap him on the knuckles, but he gets off the mark with two and survives until the break. Ravindra Jadeja\u2019s middle stump just landed somewhere in Wednesday! Josh Hazlewood is producing an absolute gem of a spell here and gets another. This time it\u2019s full and straight and swinging in, and with India\u2019s makeshift No5 playing all around it, his timber is splattered. What a game of cricket this is. 38th over: India 120-3 (Pujara 34, Jadeja 2) We\u2019re close to tea now on what has been another enthralling day of Test cricket. And to think there are still two Test left after these. I might need oxygen tank. Pujara just needs to get through to the next session, so pads up to the off-spinner. \u201cGood Gary,\u201d says Matthew Wade, giving himself wiggle room for grander compliments when it spins even more than this. Which is quite a lot. 37th over: India 120-3 (Pujara 34, Jadeja 2) Sohid Ahmed writes in now. \u201cRussell, we have work to do. cCn you please not make it so exciting? I am on the verge of asking my boss for a half day.\u201d To misapply a well-worn quote from former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke, any boss who doesn\u2019t give his staff a half-day to watch this is a bum! Hazlewood continues here. Have I mentioned that he\u2019s a genius, and that Steve Smith was very smart to bring him on? I hope so. Hazlewood finishes this over with another throaty LBW shout against Jadeja, but Nigel Llong shakes his head. He\u2019s had a reasonable day today, the ump. 36th over: India 119-3 (Pujara 33, Jadeja 2) I\u2019m currently receiving a lot of emails containing the words \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d and \u201cbatsman\u201d. Sorry folks, that is not a rule, and never has been. Tough for Kohli, but as the third umpire said, he could see nothing to conclusively prove that the Indian skipper got bat on it. Meanwhile, Nathan Lyon is back on the ground and back on to bowl. He starts with a shocker, and Pujara batters it over mid-wicket for four. Jadeja faces the last couple and remains circumspect, nudging two runs to leg to get off the mark. 35th over: India 112-3 (Pujara 28, Jadeja 0) This just gets better. Now Ravindra Jadeja strides out to the middle rather than normal No5 Ajinkya Rahane, who is out of form and now sliding down the order. Bizarre, and utterly brilliant. He sees off the rest of the Hazlewood over, though Hazlewood finishes it with another LBW shout. Kohli stands in the sheds watching TV replays. He is not amused. Before all this had even happened, I got this email from Phil Withall: \u201cThis is hypnotic cricket, properly absorbing Test cricket. Having just finished reading a book on England\u2019s singlehanded attempts to stiffle cricket with dour batting in the sixties and seventies this competitive, evenly balanced stuff is a panacea to the soul! Loving it.\u201d Amen, Phil. This game is not even over and I\u2019m seriously considering getting the scorecard tattooed across my back. Kohli is gone! I take back everything I said. Steve Smith is a genius. I am an idiot. Pace has done the job. The danger man is gone cheaply again! Hooley dooley this is some sort of Test match. It took an age for the third umpire to review all the evidence, but the Indian skipper is on his way back to the pavilion and this game is well and truly alive. India lead by 25 runs but face a real battle here. Well, well, well. Kohli is reviewing it, but this looks salmon trout. Kohli thinks he\u2019s feathered an edge before it hit his pad. 34th over: India 110-2 (Pujara 28, Kohli 13) Something is up with Nathan Lyon, and he departs the ground. Glenn Maxwell comes out as sub-fielder, and O\u2019Keefe takes Lyon\u2019s end. Not ideal for Australia. With only a small amount of diplomacy, Michael Clarke is starting to rip into Steve Smith\u2019s captaincy here, particularly his (under)use of the spinners. He wonders why O\u2019Keefe doesn\u2019t have a short leg in place in this over, and I can see what he means. 33rd over: India 106-2 (Pujara 27, Kohli 10) Hmm, right as I\u2019m waxing lyrical about the pressure being built by O\u2019Keefe, Steve Smith reintroduces the pace of Hazlewood. His first ball strays onto Kohli\u2019s pads and gets tenderised on its way to the deep mid-wicket boundary. Deary me. Kohli will be loving this. Unless Australia nip him out cheaply this could get very desperate very quickly. That tail end collapse is looking even worse now. 32nd over: India 100-2 (Pujara 26, Kohli 5) Oooh, Pujara gets very lucky here, dancing down the wicket at Lyon and missing an on drive. The ball thuds into his pad but might have snuck through a gap for a stumping opportunity. Matthew Hayden is talking about building up the bricks. Hopefully whatever wall eventuates will keep him away from the microphone. A single to Kohli brings up 100 for India, and they now lead by 13 runs. Push that past 150 and Australia might be in serious bother. Much is at stake in the following half-hour, and whatever comes in the final session. 31st over: India 98-2 (Pujara 25, Kohli 4) O\u2019Keefe must wish he could roll up the Indian wickets and take them home with him, the way his career has turned the corner in the last two weeks. He\u2019s probing away again in this over, but the main threat for now is at Lyon\u2019s end. What O\u2019Keefe is doing far better than the pacemen before is building pressure. He\u2019s got a wicket, but he\u2019s also bowled plenty of dot balls. 30th over: India 96-2 (Pujara 23, Kohli 4) Pujara is a little more comfortable to Lyon now, and drives handsomely to long on for a single before Kohli dices with danger by pushing one inches past the right hand of Handscomb at short leg. He gets two but he\u2019s still not comfortable. \u201cNo idea, Gaz!\u201d cries Wade, which is a bit rich given the way he\u2019s been keeping in the last few Tests. 29th over: India 94-2 (Pujara 23, Kohli 2) \u201cBowling SOK-y\u201d cries Matthew Wade behind the stumps, reminding everyone of what his mouth is missing. O\u2019Keefe beats Kohli\u2019s edge was an absolute peach, and must weather a testing little spell here from the Australian spinners. The stage is perfectly set for his combative genius, I reckon. 28th over: India 93-2 (Pujara 22, Kohli 2) \u201cSeriously great advert for test cricket here after England\u2019s rather tame regression to the home team dominance paradigm,\u201d says reader Brian Withington, and for the sake of stopping an argument, I think he\u2019s a Brit. Pujarafinishes the Lyon over with a single and looks switched on, though Matthew Wade is carrying on as though he\u2019s facing up with the wrong end of the bat in his hands. 27th over: India 92-2 (Pujara 21, Kohli 2) There is no escape from the spin now for Pujara, and he\u2019s looking only slightly more comfortable against O\u2019Keefe than he was early on against Lyon. With the left-armer rushing between balls, Pujara tries to make him wait, and O\u2019Keefe does a good job acting as though these demands are completely unreasonable. Buckle in for a thrilling final hour of this second session, folks. 26th over: India 89-2 (Pujara 18, Kohli 2) Kohli is getting a huge stride in as he gets forward to counter the sharp spin of Nathan Lyon, but even a batsman as brilliant as him looks human in the face of some sublime bowling. Lyon has a slip, a leg slip and a short leg, and by the end of the over he\u2019s also wearing a slightly sadistic grin by his affable standards. He probably fancies another eight poles here. 25th over: India 87-2 (Pujara 17, Kohli 1) \u201cIf catches win matches then Australia have already won,\u201d says Matthew Hayden, who might actually be demented. Anyway, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s introduction has had the impact we all thought it might, scores are now level, and batting wizard Virat Kohli is at the crease. What else would you rather be doing on a Tuesday, I ask you? Steve Smith you genius! But also not... The Aussie skipper took an age to bring Steve O\u2019Keefe on, and now that he has they\u2019ve combined for the wicket of the danger man. The act itself was remarkable: Smith leapt to his right at first slip and reeled in what looked an impossible chance. It\u2019s a one-hander of the highest order. Holy moly. Rahul can\u2019t believe it. but he has to go. It\u2019s a pity. Rahul made this dicey pitch look like day two in Adelaide. His half-century has India on the brink of a lead and that\u2019s no mean feat. It took a miracle catch to dismiss him. How good is cricket? 24th over: India 83-1 (Rahul 51, Pujara 14) Rahul faces up to Lyon and gives about 1/8th of a chance when he turns one hard to leg. It gets to Handscomb very quickly at short leg, and you can\u2019t really fault him, or call it a drop. In relative terms, Pujara is also more comfortable against the off-spinner and gets one. This is genuinely absorbing Test cricket at the moment. 23rd over: India 81-1 (Rahul 50, Pujara 13) In a surprise to absolutely nobody bar Steve Smith, the Indians continue to profit from pace bowling when Rahul lathers a half-volley through cover for another boundary off Starc, then flicks off his pads with class to pick up two. Might Darren Lehmann or the bowling coach David Saker send a memo out to the skipper at this point? O\u2019Keefe stands with his hands on his hips as Rahul strokes a single off the final delivery of the over, which brings up his half-century from 82 deliveries. He\u2019s making batting look ridiculously easy when you consider the grim efforts of the other 21 batsmen in this game. 22nd over: India 74-1 (Rahul 43, Pujara 13) Fascinating stat: Lokesh Rahul averages 60 in the first innings of Tests but only 16 in the second. This is now his highest score in the second innings. He\u2019s playing with house money. In an odd moment of this over, he backs away as Lyon moves in and gets bowled by a dead ball. Somebody is moving around in front of the sight screen again. Lyon had an opportunity to work Pujara over here, but his first delivery of the over was short and allowed his bunny to pull a single. Rahul handles the rest with aplomb. 21st over: India 70-1 (Rahul 40, Pujara 12) A run-out is the last thing India needs at this point but Pujara almost perishes running to the danger end for a Rahul single. It was Pujara\u2019s call, to be fair. A direct hit from gully might have had him in trouble but the throw misses. But more to the point, why is Mitchell Starc replacing Hazlewood and not Steve O\u2019Keefe? Spin is the clear threat here, so it\u2019s all a bit baffling from Steve Smith. Pujara has a grand old time flicking the paceman to leg and restoring his confidence a little. 20th over: India 66-1 (Rahul 39, Pujara 9) Again Rahul decides it\u2019s best to concede the over to Lyon and shield his partner, though Pujara might actually want to face a ball at some stage. Probably at the other end. Rahul eventually takes a single from the penultimate delivery, and Pujara\u2019s in all sorts for the final one. So...the original plan was a good one. 19th over: India 65-1 (Rahul 38, Pujara 9) Somewhat surprisingly, Hazlewood gets another over. Personally I think it\u2019s time for some Steve O\u2019Keefe, which is underlined when the tired paceman fires one down the leg side and gets turned for a gimme boundary. Puzzlingly, Rahul tries to ramp a short one over the cordon, which doesn\u2019t seem wise. Luckily for him he fails to make contact. That aside, he\u2019s continuing where he left off in the first innings, and boy didn\u2019t India need his 90 runs then. They\u2019re starting to feel like 200 as this game wears on. He\u2019s also kept the strike for Lyon\u2019s over. 18th over: India 60-1 (Rahul 33, Pujara 9) Lyon\u2019s bowling to Rahul again in this over, and turning it sharply to put his close-in fieldsmen into play. There is a slip, a leg slip and a short leg, but when his third delivery keeps low, Rahul does very well to get bat on it and avoid an LBW demise. It\u2019s fantastic bowling by Lyon. It actually has the vibe of those times when Harbhajan Singh was off on one and tormenting the Aussies. Rahul gets a single from the final delivery to keep the strike. He\u2019s shepherding Pujara to safety here. Brilliant batting under immense pressure. 17th over: India 59-1 (Rahul 32, Pujara 9) Pujara is on his fourth life here, and takes advantage by opening the face and gliding Hazlewood down to third man for a boundary. The big paceman might be out of gas here, so from the next over at his end we might see a change. 16th over: India 55-1 (Rahul 32, Pujara 5) \u201c87 is an unlucky number in the Australian culture,\u201d says Brett Lee, referring to Australia\u2019s first innings lead. It\u2019s utter hogwash, of course, though Nathan Lyon might be starting to disagree. This over he manages to avoid any further frustration, though it\u2019s only because Pujara is standing at the non-striker\u2019s end throughout. 15th over: India 53-1 (Rahul 30, Pujara 5) Something worth mentioning as Josh Hazlewood is hit for Lokesh Rahul\u2019s 1000th run in Test cricket: Che Pujara has been dismissed five times in Tests by Nathan Lyon. In the last ten minutes he\u2019s given no less than three chances as Lyon works him over. This is the primary contest right now, and it\u2019s enthralling. Rahul will have the strike to start with in the next over. He might want to keep it. 14th over: India 50-1 (Rahul 27, Pujara 5) Rahul turns a single towards fine leg to get off strike, which seems a good idea the way Lyon is bowling. Sure enough, the second ball of the over is ANOTHER DROPPED CATCH! It passed Wade\u2019s right pad \u2013 and really should have been his \u2013 but it\u2019ll go down as a Steve Smith drop. The Aussie skipper dived to his left at first slip but he couldn\u2019t see the ball until it was until late, and it just slaps into his palm before hitting the turf. Matthew Wade is having a shocker here. Lyon is bowling like a dream here but he could do with some help. Pujara survives. 13th over: India 47-1 (Rahul 25, Pujara 4) Hazlewood continues with diligent intentions, but he\u2019s a little inconsistent with his line and length so there are singles on offer for both batsmen. He attacks the stumps again with his final delivery but Rahul keeps it out. Strap in for some more of that Nathan Lyon chaos in the next over. This could be fun. 12th over: India 44-1 (Rahul 23, Pujara 3) Ooft. Big turn for Lyon with his first delivery of the session. Rahul is forward to it but it jags in at an alarming angle to rap him on the front pad. Matthew Wade being Matthew Wade, he screams for an LBW decision, but there\u2019s nothing doing. Rahul composes himself and gets off strike, then Pujara pushes through cover for two. Then a drop! Another beautiful delivery from Lyon \u2013 keeping lower this time \u2013 takes a decent deviation of Pujara\u2019s outside edge and thuds into Matthew Wade\u2019s right pad. He didn\u2019t get the gloves anywhere near it. He was so far from taking that you could actually argue it wasn\u2019t a chance at all. The next is half a chance for a catch at short leg too. It\u2019s all happening for Lyon. 11th over: India 41-1 (Rahul 21, Pujara 1) Che Pujara is the new man for India, and he\u2019ll be aiming to improve on his strange showing in the first innings, where he looked well set on 17 before getting himself out. He\u2019s off the mark with a single and Nathan Lyon will pair with the wicket-taker Hazlewood in the next over. What a start to the second session for Australia! Josh Hazlewood appeared after the break with a few innocuous deliveries but then ripped through the defences of Indian opener Abhinav Mukund from around the wicket, castling him with the fourth ball of the session. Perfect start for Australia. Some very sad news for lovers of great Australian sportswriting Trevor Grant, the longtime sportswriter at the Herald Sun, Sunday Press, The Age, Sporting Globe and Newsday, has died at the age of 65. There is a tribute to him here by his former colleague Jon Anderson, but it suffices to say he was one of the most inquisitive, humane and excellent sports journalists in Australia, and a must-read cricket writer for much of his almost 50-year career. I have no idea how this is calculated but it looks good for India 10th over: India 38-0 (Rahul 20, Mukund 16) Lyon\u2019s over is an accurate and probing one, but Rahul and Mukund both push singles on their way to seeing off the threat. They couldn\u2019t have done much better in this 35-minute barrage. They\u2019ve chipped off 38 runs to trail by 49, and didn\u2019t lose a wicket. The Australians will be a little disappointed with that. None of the four bowlers used produced anything compelling. The net result: India\u2019s best session of the series. 9th over: India 35-0 (Rahul 18, Mukund 15) Steve O\u2019Keefe does indeed appear for a pre-lunch over now, but it won\u2019t be the last of the session. Rahul nudges a single to cover and knock me down with a feather, but Mukund drops his glove as he runs through for it, eking out a bit of time in the process. Then he pulls away from the final delivery as well. It doesn\u2019t work. O\u2019Keefe is through his six deliveries in a flash, so Lyon will have one more over. 8th over: India 34-0 (Rahul 17, Mukund 15) Hmm, there was a little more to the Starc-Mukund conversation at the end of the last over, though it was a one-way street. Starc was unloading on the Indian opener. I wonder what Ian Healy will think. Lyon continues to left-handed Mukund, and he\u2019s getting a decent amount of spin in this over, coming around the wicket and fizzing it past the outside edge. In a moment of madness, Mukund leaves the last, which goes on with the flight and misses the off stump by a matter of inches. Mukund chuckles, but that wasn\u2019t his finest moment. 7th over: India 33-0 (Rahul 16, Mukund 15) Steve Smith might have been tempted to give Steve O\u2019Keefe an over here but sticks with Starc. The Indian openers continue to take brisk singles, which has been an obvious ploy to set a tone early in their innings. So far it\u2019s working. Mukund can\u2019t cash in on a wild and wooly short one from Starc, which he attacks with a full-blooded hook shot but misses. Brilliantly, he does latch on to another, top-edging it rather unconvincingly but picking up a six in the process. Starc laughs because crying wouldn\u2019t inspire confidence. 6th over: India 25-0 (Rahul 15, Mukund 8) Spin time now as Nathan Lyon wanders in to replace Josh Hazlewood. That seems sensible to me. Something needed to change, and he\u2019s worth a go before lunch. He\u2019s also on a hat-trick after taking wickets with his final two deliveries of the first innings. Mukund keeps the first one out with a solid forward defence, and when he\u2019s on the back foot he\u2019s offering a dead straight bat. Without a diving stop from Warner at point, Mukund also might have picked off a boundary from a half-tracker but contents himself with a single. Not much turn for Lyon in his first over. Here\u2019s a little more on Ian Healy\u2019s dig at Virat Kohli: 5th over: India 24-0 (Rahul 15, Mukund 7) We\u2019ll have 15 minutes more play before lunch, which probably means three overs after this one from Starc. He comes around the wicket to Rahul but both he and his partner are handling things comfortably at the moment. They might not want to go off the way the early momentum has gone in their favour. 4th over: India 20-0 (Rahul 12, Mukund 6) Remember half an hour ago when I floated a theory about India being bowled out for 75? Funny thing: I was hacked. The IT boffins tell me the security breach has since been fixed. Speaking of remedies, Josh Hazlewood seems to have reined his line in a decent amount now, and this is much tidier in his second over. A single to Rahul is the only damage and there\u2019s a quarter of a LBW shout against Mukund from the final delivery. Not out. 3rd over: India 19-0 (Rahul 11, Mukund 6) Rahul is making himself a little vulnerable in one sense; Starc\u2019s extra pace means he\u2019s not opting to bat outside his crease as per the approach of the Australians, thus he\u2019s a greater liability to be trapped in front by Starc\u2019s yorker. Still, the big left-armer has to nail one for that to be a problem. At the moment he\u2019s taking the Ishant approach and pitching it a yawning distance outside off stump. Wade mis-gloves a lifter to concede a bye and looks like he\u2019d prefer to be attending a four-hour lecture on medieval crop rotation than dealing with this variable bounce. Mukund gets going by whipping Starc through mid-wicket for an over-ending boundary. Starc went for the yorker there and misfired. 2nd over: India 14-0 (Rahul 11, Mukund 2) Matthew Wade is grimacing already, and you can\u2019t really blame him. Hazlewood steams in with a wide one and as well as taking off at right angles towards the cordon, it bounces a couple of times before Wade has to stop it. I hope he\u2019s wearing a mouthguard. The next ball takes off like the pitch is the WACA circa 1975. Rahul continues his bright start by clipping a compact and effective straight drive to the fence when Halzwood over-pitches. This is a dreadful start by Australia\u2019s opening bowlers. Both have bowled six entirely different deliveries. Line and length would do the job here. Even Mukund gets a couple. 1st over: India 7-0 (Rahul 6, Mukund 0) We\u2019re away in India\u2019s second innings, and facing up to start with is Lokesh Rahul, the only major contributor of the first innings. He immediately clips Starc down to fine leg for a single. Less settled in this line-up is Abhinav Mukund, who hasn\u2019t played a Test in six years and looks a bit rusty when he fences outside off stump to Starc first up. The Aussie laughs, then literally licks his lips. Mukund gets off strike thanks to a bye when a huge but innocuous deviation off a crack sends the ball darting past Matthew Wade. Starc has an enthusiastic LBW shout against Rahul but there\u2019s a thick inside edge and Nigel Llong is having none of it. That swung appreciably, but Starc errs next up by putting another on Rahul\u2019s hip; this time he makes solid contact to send it crashing to the fence at fine leg. Money for jam. Showing admirable intent, Rahul scampers through for a quick single to retain the strike. He looks a million bucks. Mukund is about as convincing as a velcro Billabong wallet. Losing 4-7 is hardly an ideal way to finish Though Australia\u2019s nose is slightly ahead here. In more good news, Robert McLiam Wilson\u2019s migraine must be clearing. He writes: \u201cReasons to wish you were Australian: Vol I \u2013 every single time any Aussie ever says \u2018crook\u2019 or \u2018strides\u2019 (I was born to say such things but neither work convincingly with my accent). Mind you, I feel something the same when Americans say \u2018doofus\u2019 or \u2018No shit, Sherlock\u2019.\u201d \u201cAustralia are looking very good here. Building a serious unit just in time to absolutely destroy Joe Root\u2019s nascent captaincy during the Ashes. Yes, this is that most unusual thing \u2013 a gleeful preview of a lifetime of flashbacks.\u201d The Indian openers are now making their way to the middle, and their second innings will be under way shortly. WICKET! Hazlewood c Rahul b Jadeja 1 (Australia all out for 276) That is that. Jadeja finishes with 6-63 from 21.4 overs having done a superb job finishing off the Aussies. The final wicket was Hazlewood, who thumped one down to long on but not far enough to avoid Rahul in the deep. The tourists lead by 87 runs and will have somewhere in the vicinity of 35 minutes to jag a few wickets before lunch. 122nd over: Australia 275-9 (O\u2019Keefe 3, Hazlewood 1) Does anyone else get the sneaky feeling India might be bowled out for 75 on this track? Just me? A qualifier: Josh Hazlewood is playing Ashwin comfortably in this over, and he\u2019s hardly Sir Garfield Sobers. 121st over: Australia 275-9 (O\u2019Keefe 3, Hazlewood 1) Hazlewood survives the hat-trick ball and gets a single to boot. Having bowled half as many overs as Ravi Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja now has 5-62 from 21 overs of canny left-arm spin. That was an outstanding over to reduce the Australians to nine down. They lead by 86 runs at the moment, and that could have been a far bigger deficit for India. Jadeja is on a hat-trick! Lyon is gone for a golden duck and things are falling away very quickly for the Australians. Often their tailenders have got them out of bother, today they\u2019re falling like nine pins. The tourists have lost their last three wickets for five runs. It\u2019s given, and Lyon opts for the last chance saloon review. If he fails, Jadeja is on a hat-trick! Wade\u2019s gone! It was a hit and hope referral, that one, but it was heading straight for the stumps when it struck him in line. Off he trots and the rest of them stop for drinks. Well that answers the question about Jadeja\u2019s fitness, though Matthew Wade\u2019s stay might be over. He\u2019s been given out and he conferences with O\u2019Keefe before asking for a review. Worth a shot. 120th over: Australia 274-7 (Wade 40, O\u2019Keefe 3) Hmm, has Ravi Jadeja just crocked himself diving in the outfield? He\u2019s certainly grimacing in pain after Wade scurries through for a single. It looks like his hamstring or buttock is the issue. Sod\u2019s law has it that he\u2019s forced into another chase soon after. In the next over we\u2019ll see how it\u2019ll alter his delivery stride, if at all. 119th over: Australia 271-7 (Wade 39, O\u2019Keefe 1) Steve O\u2019Keefe gets off the mark with a single, and it is worth mentioning at this point that he too can handle a cricket bat. In first-class cricket he averages 28.74 with nine half-centuries. One more here would just about get Australia over the line. 118th over: Australia 269-7 (Wade 38, O\u2019Keefe 0) OBO favourite Robert McLiam Wilson arrives now with his first dispatch of the Test. I won\u2019t hold it against him that it\u2019s taken until day three, because it appears he\u2019s crooker than that Nigel Llong decision from earlier in the over. \u201cAs I enter the third day of a migraine that has, so far, prevented me from seeing any of this game, I\u2019m manning up and squinting through the pain just in case it doesn\u2019t go the distance. In my altered state, two things seem very clear to me. One, no one ever knows what to do about Jadeja (including his own captain, sadly). Two, Mitchell Starc is now just really good at everything, isn\u2019t he? Have you got any Aspirin?\u201d Yes. And no. Though you mozzed Starc very well with that. Sheesh. Starc goes! Finally he latched onto a slog sweep, but I was wrong about the distance covered; he picks out Jadeja at cow corner, though the latter has to do some very smart work moving around to take the catch. With that wicket down, Australia have three more in the bank and lead by 80 runs. Forty more and they\u2019ll be reasonably content. OK, I was completely wrong on that one. It\u2019s been overturned! Starc lives to fight another day. And it\u2019s been given! Starc immediately reviews but the replays don\u2019t look good for him. 117th over: Australia 267-6 (Wade 37, Starc 25) This is actually much better from India. Jadeja has a wide-ish leg gully in place as he comes around the wicket to Wade and when he claims an inside edge the ball nearly reach that man. Wade weathers a searching five deliveries and then plays a beautiful stroke, dancing down the wicket and gently driving past mid-off for a boundary. 116th over: Australia 262-6 (Wade 33, Starc 24) Ashwin changes his plan of attack and comes around the wicket to Wade. He\u2019s got a slip, a silly point and a man on the 45 (that is a close-in fine leg or a deep leg gully, in case you\u2019re wondering). At least it gives Wade something else to think about, and he\u2019s watchful and defensive in this over. Maiden. 115th over: Australia 262-6 (Wade 33, Starc 24) Kohli\u2019s seen enough of Ishant now, and I don\u2019t entirely blame him on that front. Ravindra Jadeja appears for his first bowl of the day, and Wade is crouching low to sweep him for a single down to fine leg. Starc does even better, opening the face and running one to third man to pick up two. It\u2019s all Australia so far. The Indian bowlers are really battling. 114th over: Australia 257-6 (Wade 31, Starc 21) This is turning into a pesky partnership for Virat Kohli and his side. It now totals 35 runs from just under 13 overs, and Australia\u2019s lead has stretched to 68 with a couple of bys in this over. Ashwin has half a LBW shout against Starc but it\u2019s a rather desperate one, and not taken seriously by Nigel Llong. 113th over: Australia 255-6 (Wade 31, Starc 21) Ishant was approaching Wade from around the wicket before, but he comes over now, which means he\u2019s a bit straighter in his approach, and no less likely to miss out on an LBW if he\u2019s not going to bowl straight. He draws Matthew Wade into a thick outside edge but it\u2019s low and wide of the cordon, and runs away for four. Unlucky. 112th over: Australia 249-6 (Wade 25, Starc 21) Ravi Ashwin is coming over the wicket to Starc, spinning it from a fourth stump line outside leg, but when he straightens up a bit Starc angles the bat and gets a couple through gully. He\u2019s also throwing the kitchen sink at those slog-sweeps I mentioned earlier, but can\u2019t quite make contact. When he does it might clear the stadium roofline. 111th over: Australia 247-6 (Wade 25, Starc 19) Starc misses out on clipping one to fine leg but Wade scurries through for a leg bye, making his ground well before Saha throws down the stumps with his glove still on. Fair effort, that. I know containment is the name of the game for Ishant, but his economy rate is a moot point when Ashwin isn\u2019t taking wickets at the other end. BOWL IT AT THE STUMPS, ISHANT! 110th over: Australia 246-6 (Wade 25, Starc 19) Ashwin continues to Starc, who is often shaping to slog sweep but having difficulty wedding his premeditated stroke to the delivery in question. Matthew Hayden wants him to hit it flat and straight, which is his best suggestion in a while. A misfield gives Starc a single, and he retains the strike. 109th over: Australia 245-6 (Wade 25, Starc 18) Ishant returns and finally gets one in the vicinity of the stumps, but it\u2019s angling into Starc\u2019s pads and he clips it away for three hany runs. So far so bad from the Indian paceman, who was excellent yesterday if a little wide with his line. Something else worth asking, re the Mitch Marsh debate: is he really needed when Starc is batting this well? Another thing: I haven\u2019t received one publishable email about Ian Healy yet, but will keep checking them all off with the lawyers. 108th over: Australia 242-6 (Wade 25, Starc 15) Ravi Ashwin is on from \u201cthe spinner\u2019s end\u201d of the ground, and will settle in for most of the morning I would think. Starc greets his first with a gigantic front pad, and then he plays an accidental French cut through his legs before four byes fly away to the boundary. It might be a tough morning behind the stumps for Wriddhiman Saha. 107th over: Australia 237-6 (Wade 25, Starc 14) And we\u2019re off on day three. Ishant Sharma has the ball in his hand first up and Matthew Wade faces up, whipping his hand off the bat and shaking it when the Indian paceman gets one to rear up and rap him on the gloves. Others keep lower, and I might make an early suggestion that Ishant takes on board a lesson from his dismissal of Mitch Marsh and just bowls it at the stumps. Crazy, I know, but you\u2019re not bowling anybody or trapping them in front by pitch it a foot outside off stump on an up-and-down pitch. Balls three, four, five and six are all pitched outside off, drastically reducing the chance of a wicket as Wade gropes around. Get it together, Ishant. Ian Healy has taken a decent old swipe at Virat Kohli We\u2019re still five minutes from the first ball and the hostilities have begun. The former Australian wicketkeeper says he\u2019s \u201closing respect\u201d for the Indian skipper after his verbal skirmish with Steve Smith yesterday. \u201cThe pressure is starting to tell on (Kohli),\u201d Healy said on Melbourne radio station SEN this morning. \u201cI\u2019m losing respect for him. He\u2019s not only now continuing his disrespect of the Australian players and umpires, but I think he\u2019s putting pressure on his own players now.\u201d \u201cKohli\u2019s aggression was good for them. But I think it\u2019s not good for them anymore. He\u2019s really putting some pressure on (his players). You can read pressure all over Ravi Ashwin\u2019s face. I think there\u2019s massive cracks showing in (Kohli). He\u2019s got to be a lot more respectful of his opponents. The stuff he did with Steve Smith was unacceptable.\u201d Tell us what you really think, Heals! The pitch \u201cIt looks like a totally different morning, this morning,\u201d says Brett Lee, explaining the key differences between the concepts of yesterday and today. The pitch? The cracks are opening up like sinkholes. It\u2019s an alarming sight on day three. We\u2019re going to see a lot of deliveries staying low, and t\u2019s going to be very fun to bowl on. \u201cIf Australia get the lead to 120, India\u2019s going to have their backs to the wall,\u201d says Sunny Gavaskar, and he\u2019s pretty much spot-on there. \u201cIt\u2019s almost been a pitch of two halves,\u201d adds Lee. Somebody gag him, please. On Shaun Marsh \u201cI don\u2019t really know why he comes under the scrutiny he does,\u201d says national selector Mark Waugh of Australia\u2019s No4. Waugh is, remember, a member of the national selection panel, so has something of a vested interest in Marsh\u2019s success on this tour. It\u2019s tough on Usman Khawaja, who really should be in this side instead of Mitchell Marsh, but the older brother was magnificent yesterday. He\u2019s not quite as stylish as Khawaja, but there is something inarguably artful about his batting on Asian pitches. He had a bit of luck in his 66 yesterday, but he did precisely the job he was brought in for. Preamble Hello all and welcome to day three of the Bangalore Test. Russell Jackson here to take you through the first couple of sessions on what will prove the pivotal day in deciding the result. In actual fact, I have a feeling that 45 minutes of big hitting by Mitchell Starc could put India out of the game and with it, the series. If you disagree, please do hit me with an apoplectic email or tweet. Australia hold a 48-run lead at present. Push that past 140ish and it\u2019ll be very hard for the home side, though this pitch will be an absolute nightmare to bat on by the fourth innings and by then Australia might well have a chase on their hands. Resuming with Starc is Matthew Wade, who compiled a useful 25 not out last night, and is a born scrapper. I don\u2019t know about you, but I can\u2019t wait to settle in for another day of this fascinating series. Yesterday was nirvana for lovers of tense, attritional Test cricket. Long may it live. Russell will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s how yesterday went down. It was enthralling stuff.",

Three of the missiles landed 186-217 miles (300-350km) from the Oga peninsula in Japan\u2019s Akita prefecture, according to the country\u2019s defence minister, Tomomi Inada. Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, called the latest missile launch a \u201cgrave threat to national security\u201d but added that there were no reports of damage to ships or aircraft in the area. South Korea\u2019s acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn said the launches were a direct challenge to the international community. The US also condemned the launch, vowing that Washington was ready to \u201cuse the full range of capabilities at our disposal against this growing threat\u201d. \u201cThe United States strongly condemns the DPRK\u2019s ballistic missile launches tonight, which violate UN security council resolutions explicitly prohibiting North Korea\u2019s launches using ballistic missile technology,\u201d the State Department\u2019s acting spokesman, Mark Toner, said in a statement. He added: \u201cWe remain prepared \u2013 and will continue to take steps to increase our readiness \u2013 to defend ourselves and our allies from attack, and are prepared to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal against this growing threat.\u201d North Korea conducted two nuclear tests and 20 missile launches last year \u2013 a sign, say experts, that the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, is redoubling efforts to develop a nuclear arsenal capable of deterring \u201chostility\u201d from the US and South Korea. In his New Year\u2019s address, Kim claimed that the North was preparing to test fire an ICBM \u2013 a development that would dramatically raise the diplomatic and security stakes for Washington. The US defence secretary, James Mattis, warned last month that any nuclear attack on the US or its allies in the Asia-Pacific would trigger an \u201ceffective and overwhelming\u201d response. North Korea has carried out five nuclear tests and dozens of missile launches despite six rounds of UN sanctions that began after Pyongyang\u2019s first nuclear test in 2006. Concern is growing that with every new test, North Korea is edging towards developing a fully functioning ICBM that, in theory, could strike the US mainland. Donald Trump\u2019s administration has yet to publicly articulate its policy towards North Korea beyond voicing support for its alliances with Japan and South Korea, home to tens of thousands of US troops. The US president has previously described North Korea as a \u201cbig, big problem\u201d. Monday\u2019s tests were the second North Korea has conducted since Trump became president. Early last month, it test-launched a new intermediate-range missile \u2013 known as the Pukguksong-2, into the sea to coincide with Trump\u2019s summit with Abe at his Florida estate. \u201cNot only Pukguksong-2 but newer independent strategic weapons will fly high vigorously in the sky off the ground as long as the United States and the puppet regime are going ahead with their nuclear threat to us and an exercise for invasion war against the North,\u201d North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Workers\u2019 party, said in a commentary last week. Monday\u2019s launches are believed to be in protest at the start last week of huge joint military exercises involving South Korea and the US that North Korea regards as a rehearsal for an invasion. Pyongyang threatened to take \u201cstrong retaliatory measures\u201d after the annual military drills began last Wednesday but did not elaborate. Kim ordered troops to \u201cset up thorough countermeasures of a merciless strike against the enemy\u2019s sudden air assault\u201d, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said. South Korea and the US insist that the Foal Eagle exercises, which will end in late April, are designed to test the allies\u2019 preparedness for a serious military provocation from North Korea. The launches could also be designed to communicate Pyongyang\u2019s anger towards China, coming as Xi Jinping attended the 10-day annual national people\u2019s congress in Beijing. While China is the North\u2019s only main ally and biggest donor and trading partner, Beijing has not attempted to hide its opposition to Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Last month, China announced a suspension of all coal imports from North Korea until the end of the year, depriving Pyongyang of an important source of foreign currency. On Monday China\u2019s foreign ministry said Beijing opposed the missile launch but noted that it had taken place as the US and South Korea were holding \u201clarge-scale military exercises targeting North Korea\u201d. \u201cAll sides should exercise restraint and not do anything to irritate each other to worsen regional tensions,\u201d a spokesman added. Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, urged China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea, and the US \u201cto go back to the negotiating table to end wrangles and wrestles and reopen the long stalled six-party talks that once brought the Korean Peninsula nearest to denuclearisation with a settlement acceptable to all\u201d.",

Currently in Western Australia, 15% of the gas produced by each liquefied natural gas project must be kept for domestic purposes. Canavan\u2019s comments on Sky News follow a call last week from the Victorian Nationals MP Andrew Broad, for serious consideration about whether 15% of gas supply should be reserved for Australian manufacturing rather than exported. Broad, who is chairman of federal parliament\u2019s environment and energy committee, told Guardian Australia last week a national domestic gas reservation policy was worthy of serious consideration \u201cto ensure we are best using those resources to lift Australians\u2019 wealth\u201d.

At the beginning of last month, the minister said the government had already been approached by an interested party eyeing off development in the Galilee Basin, the site of the controversial Adani coalmine. But on Monday Canavan said the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund had not yet been presented with a new coal power plant proposal from a commercial player.

Defence\u2019s sexual misconduct office has been expanded to include cadets, instructing officers and their families.</p> <p>New youth safety standards and policies have also been created, Griggs said.

      "bodyText": "Disturbing evidence of abuse and violence in Australia\u2019s military cadets has acted as a \u201cvery important catalyst for change\u201d, according to the vice chief of defence. In June last year, the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse examined the experiences of Australian defence force cadets since 2000. It found there were 154 known incidents or allegations of child sexual abuse in the cadets between 2001 and April last year. Fifty-one of those involved an adult instructor and a cadet, and the remaining 103 were sexual abuse perpetrated by other cadets. It emerged that defence had been giving cadets inaccurate information on the age of consent, failing to warn instructors that sexual activity with cadets was a criminal offence, and equipping cadets with only a limited knowledge of complaint and child protection mechanisms. The royal commission revisited the cadets on Monday, asking Australia\u2019s defence leadership to outline the reforms achieved since June. The commission heard 13 new complaints of abuse have emerged between the royal commission\u2019s last hearing in June and February. The vice chief of the Australian defence force, vice admiral Raymond Griggs, said last year\u2019s evidence had acted as \u201ca very important catalyst for change\u201d. He said a reform program, known as \u201cone cadet\u201d, had brought the three service arms of the cadets together under a single headquarters with a more centralised command structure. The director generals of each cadet service now reported to Griggs and the relevant service chief. Defence had engaged Ernst &amp; Young and child protection group Bravehearts to help develop child protection policies and training packages for the cadets. Defence\u2019s sexual misconduct office has been expanded to include cadets, instructing officers and their families. New youth safety standards and policies have also been created, Griggs said. Asked what was needed to achieve cultural reform within defence and the cadets, Griggs responded: \u201cSustained, focused leadership.\u201d Counsel assisting, Gail Furness, SC, asked Griggs how he had demonstrated such leadership personally. He referred to a letter he had written after last year\u2019s royal commission hearings, in which he warned the cadets organisation must change. \u201cI will be writing a similar letter after this case study to reflect again that this matter is not something that just came and went in June last year,\u201d he said. \u201cMy own role in making sure that the One Cadet reform process goes through to completion is another part of this.\u201d",

But the Australian Medical Association has criticised the plan as an \u201cunwieldy\u201d imposition on specialists. On Monday the Consumers Health Forum of Australia called for a comparison service for specialists\u2019 fees after a study in the Medical Journal of Australia found some Australians are paying five times more than others to see a specialist depending on their need and location. The comparison service would resemble services including MySchool, which rates primary and secondary schools around the country, and petrol price comparison sites run by several state governments. The Consumers Health Forum chief executive, Leanne Wells, said medical specialists should be required to list their fees publicly to prevent \u201cbill shock\u201d from unexpectedly high charges.

      "bodyText": "The story of Indigenous Australian treaties begins long before the white man came to our lands. The story begins long before any current activists began to fight for treaties, before any governments began to talk of treaties or before any proposed representative body structures were spoken of. This story begins thousands of generations ago. There were treaties here then, between us, our mob, nation to nation agreements, tribe to tribe agreements, clan to clan agreements \u2013 treaties. Treaties on boundaries, treaties on food, partners, ceremony, ritual, hunting grounds, engineering, farming, trade ... the list goes on. A treaty was an agreement then and now it is the same. A treaty is an agreement between two or more parties. There are however, many different interpretations of a treaty. Some say a treaty can only be between sovereign nations, some say that a treaty is an agreement between two or more parties, some say that a treaty is about land, and others say it is about civil service delivery. The interpretations of what a treaty is or can be often provides more confusion than answers. I try to think of \u201cchaos not conspiracy\u201d when I think of those who dare walk the pathway toward a treaty. Essentially, there appears to be many different types of treaties that parties can choose to enter into. For me, a treaty is ultimately about hope. A treaty is a light that shines in the distance, and that light that may help us as a nation to acknowledge the atrocities of the past, and plant seeds here in the present for future generations to grow trees, a forest, perhaps even change the cultural tapestry of our nation. For me, what is just as important as that treaty light in the distance is the journey to the light and what we can accomplish along that journey. I see that on that journey toward a treaty, there is the potential for many great things, for great seeds to be planted. Not just seeds for Aboriginal and Islander Australians, but seeds for all of us who claim this nation in the shape that it is now, as our own. One of the practical seeds that we can plant while journeying toward a treaty can be what I call \u201ca quarantined election process\u201d. An Indigenous-specific election process so we can hear the Aboriginal and Islander voice on issues such as constitutional reform, who represents us and why, on policies that are directly aimed at us as a people, and of course on pivotal issues such as treaty. A quarantined election process essentially means that we see the Aboriginal and Islander vote clearly, concisely and on issues such as and similar to the issues mentioned above. Essentially we would see the collective view of Aboriginal and Islander people who chose to vote. Another practical seed could be a dispute resolution process in our cultural shape, taking into account the many issues we shoulder on a daily basis, our cultural obligations and our family and community commitments. This dispute resolution tool would go a long way toward resolving issues of lateral violence, organisational and cultural conflicts. Another seed that may be planted may be that the states, territories and commonwealth governments allocate dedicated Indigenous seats in parliament. What a voice we could have if this level of representation was enabled. Arguably, we could vote our own people into those seats with a quarantined Indigenous election process. Another seed could be a coalition of registered Indigenous state organisations and Indigenous peak agencies to determine their collective and individual role in many areas. Perhaps we could even have a 20 year Indigenous-specific strategic plan on our collective business. These are tasks that can be taken up easily by governments and our communities while we journey toward a treaty. This could be community capacity building at its best. Establishing a representative body for a treaty, a framework for a treaty and resources for a treaty can be long and arduous work. To attain a finalised treaty will be an even longer process. If we get a representative body legislated, if we pick our team(s) to represent us to fight for a treaty (or treaties) and if we then begin negotiations, the treaty process will still take years. Along the way toward a treaty, we will still lose our children to suicide, we will still lose languages, we will still be incarcerated at horrific levels, we will still see violence in our homes, communities and across society at a disproportionately higher rate than our non-Aboriginal friends, colleagues and neighbours.

      "bodyText": "A government-commissioned inquiry into child abuse in immigration detention did not speak to children because it did not want to \u201calarm or traumatise them further\u201d, the royal commission has heard. The royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse is examining how the federal government handles complaints of abuse in immigration detention, including through its response to the damning Making Children Safer report. That report, written by an independent child protection panel, found the response to almost half the reported incidents of child abuse in Australian immigration detention was inadequate. The panel criticised poor incident reporting and the department\u2019s lack of capacity to investigate child abuse complaints, and called for better risk management measures, improved information sharing and a stronger child protection framework. One of the panel\u2019s members, Margaret Allison, told the royal commission on Monday that no children were spoken to during the inquiry, aside from incidental conversations during centre visits. Allison, a former director-general of Queensland\u2019s community services department, said that was because the incidents dated back to 2008, and children\u2019s memories would have been poor. Speaking to children might have retraumatised them, she said. Counsel assisting, Gail Furness SC, asked why the panel had not spoken to children currently in detention about whether they felt protected. Allison replied: \u201cI think that again we came to the view that we didn\u2019t want to engage with those children directly or alarm or traumatise them further.\u201d Earlier, she was asked whether the panel had cooperation from the department and contractors responsible for managing the detention centres. Allison said staff within the department were initially slow to respond to requests for information, which contrasted with the position of the department\u2019s leadership. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that early on there was a sense that \u2013 although the secretary and commissioner had issued an instruction early on \u2026 I think it\u2019s fair to say that there was a lot going on at the time, and we were of the view that there was a certain lack of urgency in some quarters in responding,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we sought, and the secretary agreed that he and the commissioner would put out a fairly explicit directive to people requiring them to comply with any requests we had for information.\u201d The royal commission\u2019s inquiry is limited in scope, but follows a number of other inquiries into the welfare of children in Australia\u2019s immigration detention network. The Human Rights Commission examined the impact of prolonged detention on children through its report, The Forgotten Children, in 2014. The explosive Moss Review, which examined the Nauru processing centre, also examined claims of physical and sexual assault against children. The Moss review, released in 2015, prompted the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to set up the independent child protection panel, which reviewed incidents of abuse, neglect and exploitation involving children, and reported in May last year. On Monday the immigration department secretary, Michael Pezzullo, said it became clear that a \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d approach to the issue was needed. \u201cWe wanted a very clean, fresh look at it from someone accomplished in public administration, another person in law enforcement, another person in child welfare,\u201d Pezzullo said. \u201cWe said to [the child protection panel] very directly that it would not do their reputation any good and would not do our responsibilities \u2013 would not provide any benefit to our responsibilities, if they pulled their punches.\u201d The panel was initially given six months to report. Furness said that short amount of time appeared \u201cextraordinary\u201d, given the panel\u2019s remit. Allison agreed, but said the federal government gave the panel two extensions to complete its work. \u201cYes, at that stage I think it\u2019s fair to say that we didn\u2019t know the number of cases that we would be looking at,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became evident early on that we would need to use a sampling methodology.\u201d The panel examined 214 incidents in community detention, regional processing centres and other places of detention. Allison was unable to say how many serious sexual assaults the panel believed had occurred. \u201cIt would be very difficult for me to say that with any accuracy,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, I recall at the time my impression was that it was not remarkably dissimilar to what you would expect in child abuse statistics nationally anyway, and on the latest [Australian Institute of Family Studies] data \u2026 that I looked at, sexual abuse cases represent about one eighth of all reported child abuse matters. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t think it would be too far out of kilter with that.\u201d Pezzullo said that, currently, only one child remained in held detention, compared to 1,192 at the peak of arrivals. As at January 31, there were 234 children in community detention. Royal commission chair, Peter McClellan, asked Pezzullo why the panel\u2019s report had only been released in mid-December last year, when it was finalised in May. Pezzullo said he was \u201ckeen to ensure that we had substantial work in progress\u201d. McClellan responded: \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just released the report and shown later what you were doing in response to it? that\u2019s a fairly common way of doing things.\u201d Pezzullo said: \u201cYour honour, I would agree. On this occasion I chose partly in conferral with the minister and partly in terms of my own decision making and conferring with the border force commissioner, that we would prefer to go down this path.\u201d In August, Guardian Australia published the Nauru files, a cache of more than 2,000 incident reports, half of which involved children. They detailed assaults, sexual abuse, self-harm attempts, child abuse and living conditions in immigration detention. The revelations prompted a Senate inquiry, which is examining the factors that led to abuse, how it is investigated and the handling of complaints by the department and its contractors. The royal commission\u2019s hearing continues.",

With some honourable exceptions, good old-fashioned reporting was also absent.\u201d</p> <p>Let\u2019s look at the most famous example of how the media was used to make the Iraq war happen. </p> <p>On September 8 2002, the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/08/world/threats-responses-iraqis-us-says-hussein-intensifies-quest-for-bomb-parts.html\">published a major story by Michael R Gordon and Judith Miller</a> asserting that Iraq had \u201cstepped up its quest for nuclear weapons and \u2026 embarked on a worldwide hunt for materials to make an atomic bomb\u201d. The piece cited no named sources whatsoever. Rather, it attributed all its significant claims simply to anonymous US officials \u2013 and, by so doing, it helped launder the Bush administration\u2019s talking points, lending a liberal imprimatur to unverified (and totally untrue) claims. </p> <p>When the key members of the Bush administration launched a publicity blitz to make the war happen, they were able to quote the New York Times<em> </em>as evidence: in effect, reacting to newspaper revelations for which they themselves were responsible. </p> <p>For instance, during a CNN appearance, Condoleeza Rice urged the public to support an invasion on the basis that \u201cwe don\u2019t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud\u201d. She\u2019d lifted the phrase directly from Gordon and Miller \u2013 who\u2019d taken it from the administration.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Gordon and Miller referred to Iraq\u2019s supposed interest in acquiring high-strength aluminium tubes as an illustration of its nuclear ambitions. Again, the claims came from Bush officials. But when, at the UN General Assembly, Bush told the story, he sounded as if he were repeating a New York Times scoop.</p> <p>A similar circularity defined the propaganda campaign conducted in other countries.</p> <p>\u201cNo serious figure in the debate anywhere believes Iraq does not have [weapons of mass destruction],\u201d <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/23/1066631567231.html\">proclaimed the Australian\u2019s Greg Sheridan</a> in March 2003. He was certainly right about that. In 2002 and 2003, journalistic \u201cseriousness\u201d over Iraq was defined by participation in the feedback loop between the pro-war reporters and the pro-war politicians, who leaned upon each other like drunks at closing time, repeating and amplifying the (largely untrue) claims of the Bush and Blair administrations.</p> <p>We can see in that an obvious antecedent for Donald Trump\u2019s bizarre relationship with the media today.</p> <p>Even as Trump and his surrogates take aim at mainstream outlets, they\u2019ve established a rapport with the new, rightwing media that mimics the curious symbiosis between Bush and the New York Times\u2019 Judith Miller, with Trump relying on his alt-right journalistic enablers to reinforce and amplify his \u201calternative facts\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou look at what\u2019s happening last night in Sweden,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.pressherald.com/2017/02/19/sweden-has-no-idea-what-trump-meant-when-he-said-you-look-at-whats-happening-last-night-in-sweden/\">declared Trump in a speech in Florida</a>. \u201cSweden! Who would believe this? Sweden!\u201d</p> <p>When puzzled Swedes explained that nothing out of the ordinary had happened, Trump cited the screening of a Fox News documentary about refugees. Meanwhile, far right websites everywhere doubled-down on Trump\u2019s claim. Suddenly, Sweden \u2013 a country to which most conservatives had previously paid almost zero attention \u2013 was held up throughout the Trumposphere as a cautionary tale about immigration. </p> <p>Within the closed ecosystem of the far right media, you could thus hear a weird echo of Greg Sheridan on Iraq: \u201cno serious figure in the debate anywhere doesn\u2019t believe Sweden to be a crime-ridden hell hole.\u201d</p> <p>As the catastrophic incompetence of Bush and his cronies became more and more obvious, most of the \u201cprogressive\u201d journalists and pundits who\u2019d backed the Iraq invasion walked (or perhaps tiptoed) back their support. </p> <p>So where George W Bush cultivated certain elite liberals (the late Christopher Hitchens comes to mind) to sell his program, Trump, by necessity as much as by choice, identifies as an opponent the mainstream media in its entirety \u2013 \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d, as he recently put it. </p> <p>Yet that rhetoric still draws on the hysterical, threat-laden discourse that accompanied the march to war in Iraq.</p> <p>\u201cI accuse the media in the United States of treason.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not Steve Bannon or another Trumpite writing today. It comes from a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2002/06/16/they-heard-it-all-here-and-thats-the-trouble/c58c14af-1a65-4aa4-acf0-e743dfe19216/?utm_term=.6b55897c8ce0\">Washington Post op ed</a> published in 2002 by Dennis Pluchinsky, a senior intelligence analyst working for the US Department of State.</p> <p>Back then, that sort of stuff was remarkably common. </p> <p>Recall the <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/ten-years-ago-today-dixie-chick-dared-hit-bush-war-and-hate-campaign-began/\">fate of the Dixie Chicks</a>, boycotted and subjected to a barrage of abuse for daring to criticise Bush. Recall <a href=\"http://observer.com/2007/06/phil-donahue-strikes-back/3/\">NBC dumping Phil Donahue</a> for \u201cpresenting guests who are anti-war, anti-Bush and sceptical of the administration\u2019s motives\u201d. Recall the FBI\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/23/us/fbi-scrutinizes-antiwar-rallies.html\">systemic surveillance of anti-war activists and organisations</a>. Recall White House press secretary Ari Fleischer <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/fleischertext_092601.html\">responding to critics</a> by explaining Americans \u201cneed to watch what they say, what they do.

'Alternative facts' are just lies | Jill Abramson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in 2002, Sullivan was one of the many Bush supporters engaged in precisely that kind of intimidation against those who opposed the march to war. </p> <p>\u201cThe middle part of the country \u2013 the great red zone that voted for Bush \u2013 is clearly ready for war,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2002/12/al_gore_andrew_sullivan_and_fifth_column.html\">he wrote</a>. \u201cThe decadent Left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead \u2013 and may well mount what amounts to a fifth column.\u201d</p> <p>The extremity of the Trump presidency tends to recast past administrations in the pastel glow of nostalgia, providing an opportunity that the politicians of yesteryear have been quick to grasp. Tony Blair\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/20/tony-blair-brexit\">nosing around the British Labour party once more</a>, George Bush spoke up to defend the media against Donald Trump and John Howard, when he\u2019s not championing western civilisation, says Trump emerged as a response to political correctness.</p> <p>In that context, it\u2019s important to emphasise that many of the worst things Trump promises (torture, racial profiling, detention without trial, etc) were implemented during the Bush years. Trump\u2019s aggressive bluster might threaten a catastrophic war \u2013 but Bush, Blair and Howard actually delivered one.</p> <p>To put it another way, these men created the conditions in which Trumpism emerged. Have a look at the Palazzo report, and the extraordinary cynicism with which our leaders embarked on armed conflict. Such people are part of the problem: they\u2019re not any kind of solution.</p>",

A similar circularity defined the propaganda campaign conducted in other countries. \u201cNo serious figure in the debate anywhere believes Iraq does not have [weapons of mass destruction],\u201d proclaimed the Australian\u2019s Greg Sheridan in March 2003. He was certainly right about that. In 2002 and 2003, journalistic \u201cseriousness\u201d over Iraq was defined by participation in the feedback loop between the pro-war reporters and the pro-war politicians, who leaned upon each other like drunks at closing time, repeating and amplifying the (largely untrue) claims of the Bush and Blair administrations. We can see in that an obvious antecedent for Donald Trump\u2019s bizarre relationship with the media today. Even as Trump and his surrogates take aim at mainstream outlets, they\u2019ve established a rapport with the new, rightwing media that mimics the curious symbiosis between Bush and the New York Times\u2019 Judith Miller, with Trump relying on his alt-right journalistic enablers to reinforce and amplify his \u201calternative facts\u201d. \u201cYou look at what\u2019s happening last night in Sweden,\u201d declared Trump in a speech in Florida. \u201cSweden! Who would believe this? Sweden!\u201d When puzzled Swedes explained that nothing out of the ordinary had happened, Trump cited the screening of a Fox News documentary about refugees. Meanwhile, far right websites everywhere doubled-down on Trump\u2019s claim. Suddenly, Sweden \u2013 a country to which most conservatives had previously paid almost zero attention \u2013 was held up throughout the Trumposphere as a cautionary tale about immigration. Within the closed ecosystem of the far right media, you could thus hear a weird echo of Greg Sheridan on Iraq: \u201cno serious figure in the debate anywhere doesn\u2019t believe Sweden to be a crime-ridden hell hole.\u201d As the catastrophic incompetence of Bush and his cronies became more and more obvious, most of the \u201cprogressive\u201d journalists and pundits who\u2019d backed the Iraq invasion walked (or perhaps tiptoed) back their support. So where George W Bush cultivated certain elite liberals (the late Christopher Hitchens comes to mind) to sell his program, Trump, by necessity as much as by choice, identifies as an opponent the mainstream media in its entirety \u2013 \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d, as he recently put it. Yet that rhetoric still draws on the hysterical, threat-laden discourse that accompanied the march to war in Iraq. \u201cI accuse the media in the United States of treason.\u201d That\u2019s not Steve Bannon or another Trumpite writing today. It comes from a Washington Post op ed published in 2002 by Dennis Pluchinsky, a senior intelligence analyst working for the US Department of State. Back then, that sort of stuff was remarkably common. Recall the fate of the Dixie Chicks, boycotted and subjected to a barrage of abuse for daring to criticise Bush. Recall NBC dumping Phil Donahue for \u201cpresenting guests who are anti-war, anti-Bush and sceptical of the administration\u2019s motives\u201d. Recall the FBI\u2019s systemic surveillance of anti-war activists and organisations. Recall White House press secretary Ari Fleischer responding to critics by explaining Americans \u201cneed to watch what they say, what they do. This is not a time for remarks like this; there never is\u201d and attorney general John Ashcroft telling civil libertarians: \u201cYour tactics only aid terrorists \u2013 for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve.\u201d If we\u2019ve forgotten that period, it\u2019s probably because many of those who once urged Bush to crack down on dissenters now worry that, under President Trump, they might be targets themselves. For instance, the American essayist Andrew Sullivan recently declared Trump \u201cliterally delusional, clinically deceptive\u201d and warned that the President \u201cresponds to any attempt to correct the record with rage and vengeance.\u201d But in 2002, Sullivan was one of the many Bush supporters engaged in precisely that kind of intimidation against those who opposed the march to war. \u201cThe middle part of the country \u2013 the great red zone that voted for Bush \u2013 is clearly ready for war,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe decadent Left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead \u2013 and may well mount what amounts to a fifth column.\u201d The extremity of the Trump presidency tends to recast past administrations in the pastel glow of nostalgia, providing an opportunity that the politicians of yesteryear have been quick to grasp. Tony Blair\u2019s been nosing around the British Labour party once more, George Bush spoke up to defend the media against Donald Trump and John Howard, when he\u2019s not championing western civilisation, says Trump emerged as a response to political correctness. In that context, it\u2019s important to emphasise that many of the worst things Trump promises (torture, racial profiling, detention without trial, etc) were implemented during the Bush years. Trump\u2019s aggressive bluster might threaten a catastrophic war \u2013 but Bush, Blair and Howard actually delivered one. To put it another way, these men created the conditions in which Trumpism emerged. Have a look at the Palazzo report, and the extraordinary cynicism with which our leaders embarked on armed conflict. Such people are part of the problem: they\u2019re not any kind of solution.",

When the film was released, to overwhelming response, it made her realise just how few opportunities there were to see empowered female characters on screen, and it inspired her to found the institute.<br /></p> <p>Davis said throughout her career she\u2019d consciously chosen roles that empowered women and girls. She acknowledged that this was a luxury because she \u201chasn\u2019t run out of money yet\u201d, and added that if she ever appears as Sean Connery\u2019s comatose wife \u2013 \u201cabout right, by Hollywood standards\u201d \u2013 we should realise she\u2019s broke. </p> <p>It was when her now 14-year-old daughter was a toddler, and she started watching movies with her, that she realised how woeful the depictions of women in family movies really were.</p> <p>She was particularly struck by just how few speaking characters in these films were female. She took this point to industry colleagues, but most denied it. Well-meaning and sincere, they couldn\u2019t see a problem. </p> <p>Davis pressed on \u2013 she wanted to see the numbers. <a href=\"https://seejane.org/research-informs-empowers/gender-in-media-the-myths-facts/\">So in 2008 she sponsored the largest study</a> carried out on gender depictions in family-rated films and children\u2019s television over the past 20 years, and found that for every female speaking-character, there were 2.5 or three male characters \u2013 a figure unchanged since 1946. </p> <p>Furthermore the vast majority of those female characters were stereotypical or highly sexualised, with ambitions largely related to romance. Even crowd scenes were only made up of 17% women \u2013 a fact she jokingly attributed to her theory that perhaps screenwriters don\u2019t think women like to gather. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caa8d39e6eea35827c98a71c030c28b19c7c9c04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caa8d39e6eea35827c98a71c030c28b19c7c9c04/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geena Davis in Commander In Chef\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In TV series Commander In Chief, Davis\u2019 character Mackenzie Allen became the first female president of the United States.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kent Eanes/ABC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2005, Davis played the first female US president on TV, in the short-lived drama Commander In Chief.

Yet when women are depicted on screen in Stem roles, it was a different story, she said, pointing to the dramatic increase in the number of women wanting to study forensic science, thanks in part to the roles played by women in shows like Bones, NCIS and CSI. </p> <p>When she took these numbers to studio executives, she said they were horrified, with many vowing to do better. And while there is some way to go, it seems to have had an impact: in follow-up research, 68% said they had changed two or more of their projects; while 41% changed four or more. In fact, after hearing about the research director Mark Osmond made <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-sneaks-little-prince-20160110-story.html\">the lead character in his animated film</a>, the Little Prince, female.</p> <p>Davis was confident that there would be further progress in screen representations in the next five to 10 years, because there was a willingness to make change.

      "bodyText": "If there\u2019s one place that gender parity could happen overnight, it\u2019s within the worlds depicted on screen. So says actor Geena Davis, who gave a rousing speech about women in media at the opening session of All About Women at Sydney Opera House on Sunday. \u201cMedia can be the cure for the problem it has created,\u201d she said. After the Oscar winner was welcomed to the stage, she joked she was there to talk about how to become a movie star. Her answer was brief: star in lots of successful films. The gag got her a laugh, but it was a neat way of saying that although Davis is well known for her roles in films like Beetlejuice, The Fly, Stuart Little, A League of Their own, and that Academy Award-winning turn in The Accidental Tourist, her work is about much more than that. Indeed Davis is something of an overachiever: she\u2019s also a member of Mensa, an Olympic archer, a special envoy for women and girls in tech for the United Nations, and a mother of three. And she\u2019s becoming increasingly recognised for the work she does with her foundation See Jane, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, which she launched in 2007 and which brought her to the Australian festival on the weekend. Her speech was warm, witty and uplifting \u2013 but it didn\u2019t pull any punches. She shared the story about being the tallest kid in school, with her fondest wish \u201cto take up less space\u201d. Only when the six-foot-tall actor was 36, starring in A League of Their Own and finally appreciative of her own athletic ability, did she feel good about her body. She also spoke about the lengths she went to to win her Academy Award-nominated role in Ridley Scott\u2019s Thelma &amp; Louise, the 1991 movie that she said \u201cchanged\u201d her life. When the film was released, to overwhelming response, it made her realise just how few opportunities there were to see empowered female characters on screen, and it inspired her to found the institute. Davis said throughout her career she\u2019d consciously chosen roles that empowered women and girls. She acknowledged that this was a luxury because she \u201chasn\u2019t run out of money yet\u201d, and added that if she ever appears as Sean Connery\u2019s comatose wife \u2013 \u201cabout right, by Hollywood standards\u201d \u2013 we should realise she\u2019s broke. It was when her now 14-year-old daughter was a toddler, and she started watching movies with her, that she realised how woeful the depictions of women in family movies really were. She was particularly struck by just how few speaking characters in these films were female. She took this point to industry colleagues, but most denied it. Well-meaning and sincere, they couldn\u2019t see a problem. Davis pressed on \u2013 she wanted to see the numbers. So in 2008 she sponsored the largest study carried out on gender depictions in family-rated films and children\u2019s television over the past 20 years, and found that for every female speaking-character, there were 2.5 or three male characters \u2013 a figure unchanged since 1946. Furthermore the vast majority of those female characters were stereotypical or highly sexualised, with ambitions largely related to romance. Even crowd scenes were only made up of 17% women \u2013 a fact she jokingly attributed to her theory that perhaps screenwriters don\u2019t think women like to gather. In 2005, Davis played the first female US president on TV, in the short-lived drama Commander In Chief. She told the audience she was delighted to accept the role, seeing it as the culmination of her mission to play empowering female roles, not least because she knew the female participation in government in the US hovered \u2013 and continues to hover \u2013 at about 19%. She told the audience that number kept jumping out at her in her research: numbers for women in Congress, media, print journalism, engineering, law, the military and more all fall below 20% participation. It seemed an uneasy coincidence that the number of female characters in family movies were also around the same mark. \u201cWhat if we are inculcating generation after generation to believe that low representation of women is the norm?\u201d she asked her audience. So her institute commissioned more research: this time, a global study of gender in film in the 10 biggest film markets (including Australia) in the world. The findings were \u201cbleak\u201d, she said: of those characters seen to be holding a job, 77.5% were male and 22.5% were female. Women in leadership and science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) fields were dramatically underrepresented in film, she said, and of the 127 characters that held political office, only 12 were women. As she put it: \u201cThere are far fewer women in the workforce in the fictional world \u2013 where they make it up!\u201d This lack of onscreen depiction contributes to symbolic annihilation, she said, by which those that don\u2019t see themselves reflected on screen believe they are unimportant. She quoted damning statistics that show the more hours of television a girl watches, the fewer options she thinks she has in life. Yet when women are depicted on screen in Stem roles, it was a different story, she said, pointing to the dramatic increase in the number of women wanting to study forensic science, thanks in part to the roles played by women in shows like Bones, NCIS and CSI. When she took these numbers to studio executives, she said they were horrified, with many vowing to do better. And while there is some way to go, it seems to have had an impact: in follow-up research, 68% said they had changed two or more of their projects; while 41% changed four or more. In fact, after hearing about the research director Mark Osmond made the lead character in his animated film, the Little Prince, female. Davis was confident that there would be further progress in screen representations in the next five to 10 years, because there was a willingness to make change. Making the change behind the camera however would not be as easy. Research has shown that in the US, there are 4.8 males working behind the scenes for every female, with similar figures in Australia, where a disproportionately low number of women are employed by the industry. Where gender bias in family features is unconscious, gender bias behind the camera is conscious. \u201cThey have known for years that it\u2019s unbalanced,\u201d she said. She pointed to Glee and American Horror Story director/producer Ryan Murphy who set up the Half foundation in 2016, to have 50% representation both in front of and behind the cameras on all his productions. \u201cThat is when change will happen,\u201d Davis said. Finally, to the audience poised for a standing ovation, she said all sectors needed more women to help achieve equality: \u201cOn screen, add women; behind the camera, add women; in media, add women; in law and on corporate boards, add women.\u201d",
