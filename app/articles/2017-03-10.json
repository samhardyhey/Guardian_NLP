      "bodyText": "The federal government could gain revenue of US$4.8bn ($6.4 bn) from Chevron\u2019s Gorgon gas project between now and 2030 if it made offshore gas projects subject to a royalties regime, according to research from a Monash University academic. The Turnbull government is contemplating measures to boost the revenue it collects from offshore oil and gas projects after collections under the petroleum resource rent tax plunged after 2012-13, and crude oil excise collections fell by more than half. The Tax Justice Network has used an inquiry the government is conducting into the PRRT to argue that it should impose a 10% royalty on all offshore oil and gas projects in Australia to ensure taxpayers start getting a fair return on their natural resources. Monash University lecturer Diane Kraal, who is conducting research on integrated natural gas-to-liquids projects that extract from basins in commonwealth waters, also favours the imposition of a royalties regime for offshore oil and gas. She says that in the absence of a royalties regime, the Gorgon project will not pay any PRRT until at least 2030. Kraal says the PRRT is clearly not working as intended for gas, and imposing commonwealth royalties for offshore projects would be one way of addressing the problem, without creating double taxation. \u201cRoyalties are fully credited from any PRRT payment, so there is no double taxation,\u201d she says. Gas producers have used the review to dig their heels in over changes to the PRRT. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA), the peak national body that represents companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production operations in Australia, has told the inquiry investment is at risk if the system is overhauled. \u201cAny changes that lead to increased imposts under the resource taxation system will damage the ability of Australia to attract projects and thereby diminish the capacity to create sustainable taxation revenue streams for future generations,\u201d APPEA says in its submission to the PRRT review. But with the budget in need of more revenue, the government has made it clear it will use the review process to determine how to achieve better rates of return. Reports this week suggest the treasurer, Scott Morrison, is contemplating several options, including imposing a \u201cminimum resource tax\u201d. On Friday, the government also left open the option to pursue a separate policy change that the gas industry is opposed to \u2013 creating a domestic gas reservation to ensure a percentage of gas remains onshore for domestic use. The prime minister, who will meet gas executives next week to address a looming shortage of gas supply, refused on Friday to rule out reserving gas for domestic industry. The Australian Energy Market Operator warned this week that New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia would face gas shortages from the summer of 2018-19. It said the tight domestic gas market would have flow-on effects, including rising electricity prices, that could threaten the financial viability of commercial and industrial businesses. Last year, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission warned the government against adopting a reservation policy \u2013 be it a percentage of reserved gas supply, export controls or a national interest test \u2013 to try to address the problem of gas shortages in Australia\u2019s eastern states. The ACCC said gas reservation policies \u201cseek to shield domestic users from the effects of linking to export markets\u201d. \u201cIn the short term, such policies may reduce prices for domestic users as additional gas is forced onto the domestic market above efficient market demand,\u201d the competition watchdog said. \u201cThese artificially reduced prices weaken the economic incentives for further gas exploration and appraisal.\u201d The gas industry has rejected arguments it should face a royalties regime for offshore projects. Kraal said on Friday she had analysed all the industry submissions to the PRRT review. \u201cIt is clear that the petroleum industry has closed ranks and is calling for no change to resource taxation, such as the PRRT,\u201d she said. But she contended the industry had not supplied any substantive evidence to the inquiry to support the idea that the PRRT was operating as intended, and providing equitable returns to the public from current gas projects. \u201cNo industry submission has fully addressed the range of issues put forward by the PRRT review,\u201d she said. Kraal expressed hope that the review would countenance a wider range of views than just those of the industry because the Australian public was entitled to have adequate rates of return on resources development. She said she was a supporter of LNG development, and it was obvious Australia should welcome foreign investment, but \u201cthe hanging question is who is shaping our policy on resource taxation?\u201d",

He supports her stance on foreign ownership, saying \u201cthe sand is being taken away from underneath us\u201d, and on immigration. \u201cOne real thing that gets me is because I travel extensively overseas and in countries from the Middle East to Asia, and everywhere I go there and I\u2019ve got total respect for that country\u2019s culture and traditions, and I always do what I\u2019m supposed to do in their country,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve allowed people that are coming into our country, and they come into my country and call me a racist. I absolutely loathe that.\u201d Unlike Chester, who talks about \u201cthe bloody Moslems\u201d (always with the archaic spelling clearly pronounced) almost as often as he talks about \u201cthe bloody Liberals\u201d, Dickinson skirts around his concern, calling it \u201ca certain religious sector\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends that practise that faith that are some of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met, but if they\u2019ve got a cause it\u2019s been very much undermined by these people,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are going to tell us what we can do and what we should do.\u201d Dickinson says society has become dominated by two minority factions: the super rich and \u201cyour leftwing lunatics\u201d. He is unimpressed by the professionalisation of politics and thinks politicians have fallen out of touch. He says the media has become obsessed with negativity and spreads \u201cfalse news\u201d by taking out of context comments of people such as Hanson, who spent the week backtracking comments she made casting doubt on the merits of vaccination and in support of Vladimir Putin. Hanson, he says, is \u201cthe buzz in the bush\u201d again, after sweeping back into federal parliament leading a team of four One Nation senators in the 2016 election. The party won 4.03% of first preference Senate votes in WA, and the most recent poll has them at 9% ahead of Saturday\u2019s election. It was a significant comeback for Hanson, who lost her federal seat in 1998, led a failed Senate campaign in 2001, and spent 11 weeks in jail in 2003 on an electoral fraud conviction that was later overturned. \u201cI think the other thing people like about her, and I\u2019ve heard people say in discussion, is, you know, this lady\u2019s really got balls,\u201d Dickinson says. \u201cShe\u2019s like a rugby player, she gets knocked down but she bounces back up again.\u201d The knocks this week came from within Hanson\u2019s own party, which has been tearing itself apart over the preference deal with the Liberal party (those bloody Liberals again). On Friday Margaret Dodd, who has a high media profile as the mother of murdered teenager Hayley Dodd and has campaigned on the basis of \u201cno body, no parole\u201d laws, quit as the One Nation candidate for Scarborough, having previously described Hanson as \u201cjust a Liberal puppet\u201d. Dodd had refused to follow the preference deal. Last month the party disendorsed two other candidates who had criticised the deal, although the official reason for their dismissal was that they failed to \u201creach standards\u201d. Colin Tincknell, the party\u2019s WA leader and candidate for the upper house in the south-west, has been deeply critical of the media for focusing on troubles within the party rather than looking at the positives \u2013 that the party has 50 other candidates who have not been disendorsed. \u201cThese people are loyal to Pauline, they\u2019re loyal to me, I\u2019m absolutely rapt with the way the campaign\u2019s going,\u201d he said in a Facebook video on Thursday. \u201cSo yeah, you can listen to the bullshit from the media, but the facts are, that\u2019s one or two people. Have a look at the 50 fantastic candidates that are there behind me, behind Pauline, and are going to deliver what you guys want if they get into parliament.\u201d At Hanson\u2019s press conference on Monday, some supporters were more forthright. \u201cI would like to push some of this media out onto the road and run them over with a bus,\u201d said one man, after reporters asked a string of questions about disqualified candidates. Hanson\u2019s stump speech was met with applause. \u201cI do believe that people are absolutely so fed up with the major political parties because they are not listening to the people,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are struggling with everyday costs, the rising cost of living, jobs, people are worried for the future of their children.\u201d The future that Hanson is offering, which has comforted and appealed to many voters, is a return to the past. An Australia for Australians, or those prepared to act like Australians, a concept reminiscent of the white Australia policy formed more than 100 years ago. \u201cShe\u2019s just saying what everyone else is saying,\u201d Chester said.",

There were chances and a few nice tricks, but the only thing the Sky Blues lacked was a killer touch - although some of that can be attributed to the excellent Necevski, who answered (almost) everything thrown at him. The Mariners defence worked hard to restrict the hosts too, making them work for every opening while offering up only a handful of errors on a poor pitch in an unusually disciplined display. That said, the Sydney strikers were a little off colour as well. Not that Graham Arnold will be too worried. And despite what he says, you can bet he and the team will be celebrating if Victory drop points tomorrow. </p> <p>As for the Mariners, no one really expected them to get something from this game, but they didn\u2019t disgrace themselves either. It\u2019s perhaps a measure of how far they\u2019ve come since that early season 4-0 thrashing at this venue that they matched Sydney for long periods this time out - although Necevski had a large part in that. With Adelaide up next, they\u2019ll still feel they\u2019re not out of the running just yet, but another defeat in their last few games and it\u2019ll be curtains on another campaign.</p> <p>Well that\u2019s it from me for the night.

      "bodyText": "It wasn\u2019t exactly a classic performance but the ruthless Sydney machine rumbles on towards the minor premiership - potentially delivering a fatal blow to the Mariners\u2019 finals hopes as it does. There were chances and a few nice tricks, but the only thing the Sky Blues lacked was a killer touch - although some of that can be attributed to the excellent Necevski, who answered (almost) everything thrown at him. The Mariners defence worked hard to restrict the hosts too, making them work for every opening while offering up only a handful of errors on a poor pitch in an unusually disciplined display. That said, the Sydney strikers were a little off colour as well. Not that Graham Arnold will be too worried. And despite what he says, you can bet he and the team will be celebrating if Victory drop points tomorrow. As for the Mariners, no one really expected them to get something from this game, but they didn\u2019t disgrace themselves either. It\u2019s perhaps a measure of how far they\u2019ve come since that early season 4-0 thrashing at this venue that they matched Sydney for long periods this time out - although Necevski had a large part in that. With Adelaide up next, they\u2019ll still feel they\u2019re not out of the running just yet, but another defeat in their last few games and it\u2019ll be curtains on another campaign. Well that\u2019s it from me for the night. I\u2019ll catch you next time. 90+3 mins: I stand corrected. A corner at the death from the Mariners but - surprise, surprise - it\u2019s cleared comfortably, this time from Matt Simon. It comes back into the box from a throw but, despite a few nerves, Sydney hoof it away and that\u2019s all she wrote. 90+2 mins: It\u2019s game over and both teams know it. The Mariners just haven\u2019t been incisive enough to trouble the hosts. Pain fails to keep the ball in play from a through-ball down the left wing and that could be their last chance. 90 mins: Time running out for the Mariners. They\u2019ve played well without seriously threatening the Sky Blues. 87 mins: Sydney finishing the game as the stronger side although the Mariners are still trying to attack when they get the ball. They\u2019re finding it very difficult get any sort of penetration though. A deep free-kick into the Sydney box is scooped up comfortably by Vukovic. 86 mins: Another good flying save from Necevski, if a little showboaty (the free-kick was on target but lacked power). He pokes it away for a corner, which comes to nothing. 85 mins: Simon uses his muscle to create an opening - and then wins a free-kick about 20 metres out. Dead centre. It might be a little too close to the goal to get it up and under. 83 mins: Buijs delivers a free-kick into the box but a high header floats into Necevski\u2019s grateful arms. Sydney look the more likely to score now the game\u2019s opened up. The Mariners goalkeeper has had an impressive night though. 81 mins: Bobo races down the right and curls it towards the bottom corner - but Necevski is equal to it. A good stop although the Sydney man should have done better. That\u2019s his last act. He comes off for Simon. 77 mins: Sydney FC turning the screw now, the intensity going up a notch as the Mariners look to get back into the game and Sydney look to kill it off. Ibini cracks one off the bar. It bounces just outside the line and away to safety. Necevski didn\u2019t even see it. 75 mins: A very poor effort from Ibini is saved by Necevski. It was struck just at the right height for the keeper, not especially powerful either. Fair play to Necevski for choosing the right direction though. Why did Ibini take it? Very odd. The Mariners are still in this. 74 mins: Rose brings down Ibini in the box, poor defending from the Mariners from a fairly innocuous attack. A shame because Rose has played well. Ibini made the most of the contact but Rose had his arms wrapped around the Sydney forward. He can\u2019t have any complaints. 72 mins: A Sydney corner highlights the differences between the two defences. It\u2019s not the greatest, but it bounces through a swathe of players before the danger finally passes. Wilkinson (or someone in a Sky Blue shirt) would have put his foot through that if it had been at the other end, safety first. Now you\u2019re talking. A guaranteed booking at the very least. 69 mins: I\u2019m not sure why the Mariners are even bothering with high balls into the box - the Sky Blues are dominating in the air. Another thumping defensive header clears the potential danger. Holsoko comes off for Mariners old boy Ibini. 67 mins: Montgomery with a chip into the box from a free-kick but it\u2019s defended well by Sydney. Again. The game has certainly opened up though, hopefully we\u2019ll see a few more chances in the last 20 minutes. 65 mins: Easy as it is for me to bemoan the lack of urgency and directness from both sides, the state of the pitch isn\u2019t exactly helping the flow of the game. Too many bobbles for the players to feel confident in their passes and runs. 64 mins: Galloway with some nice twists and turns to keep the Mariners out of danger despite the attention of two Sky Blue shirts. The visitors swing forward and, for once, they have men in support. Risky but necessary. 62 mins: Here we go. Pacey Pain on for big Bingham. The Mariners going for it. 61 mins: Bobo with a strike but Rose defends well enough to make sure it\u2019s not a clean connection and the ball bobbles out for a goal-kick. 60 mins: Well we\u2019re on the hour mark and surely Okon will be thinking of making a change some time soon. For all their huff and puff they\u2019ve barely tested Vukovic. 58 mins: Sydney on the attack now. They haven\u2019t done much of that so far this half, although that will surely change as the game goes on. Free-kick to the Sky Blues as Zullo goes down under a harsh O\u2019Donovan tackle. Too far out for a shot. It\u2019s drilled into the box and bounces harmlessly off a press of yellow shirts. 56 mins: There\u2019s been no real urgency in the game since that early surge from the champions-elect. The good news is that will have to change at some stage soon if the Mariners want to get back into this game. Sydney content just to mop up each attack and probe away when a mistake is made. 54 mins: The Mariners have certainly had their fair share of possession, and look quite comfortable playing it on the deck. Until they get in the final third - then they seem to run out of ideas. Story of their season. 52 mins: O\u2019Donovan offside from a chip over the top. Vukovic got there first anyway. Come on boys, a bit more va va voom please. 50 mins: Sydney on the attack now, muscling past Mariners players without really opening up enough space to get a clear shot away. Necevski flaps a little at a cross but it\u2019s harmless enough in the end. 47 mins: Another slow start, much like the first half. The Mariners with a few early touches but not in dangerous positions. They try to find a way through the Sydney defence but Sky Blue shirts close out each potential gap like the cliffs in the original version of Clash of the Titans. Peeeeep! And we\u2019re back, the Mariners getting us under way. They need to pick up where they left off - and then go up a gear. If they can. And that\u2019s it for the first 45 - not quite the mauling it threatened to be in the opening exchanges but Sydney will still be the happier of the two sides. Good finish from the Mariners though. More of the same and this might actually get juicy. See you in 15. 45+1 mins: The Mariners are finishing the half well, although every time Sydney get a sniff they look more dangerous. Not much injury time. 44 mins: O\u2019Donovan fails to connect with (what would have been) a fierce header in the box. That could, perhaps should, have been an equaliser. He left Buijs standing. 41 mins: Little bit more excitement to finish the half, both sides looking to snatch one before the break without really creating a clear chance. Sydney still look more likely to score but the Mariners are willing to commit men forward for the first time this half. 39 mins: Buijs blocks a potentially dangerous cross to the near post from O\u2019Donovan. Montogomery whips in the corner but it hits a wall of Sky Blue. Sydney race up the other end, with the Mariners defence bursting a vessel to keep up - and they just manage to keep the danger at bay. Just. 37 mins: Good response from the Mariners, with a spell of pressure around the Sydney box. It comes to nothing, a poor ball to Roux on the right flying out for a goal-kick. 35 mins: Ooo, almost 2-0. Bit of a scramble in the box and it falls to Grant - who can\u2019t get it past a wall of yellow and blue bodies. It falls to Brosque who smashes it over. 31 mins: Not sure if it\u2019s a good thing or not that the Sky Blues haven\u2019t gone for the jugular. It\u2019s not thrilling football at the minute but at least this is still a contest - if the hosts had forced the issue, it could be game over by now. Then again, the Mariners might have found a gap in a counter-attack and equalised. Coulda, woulda shoulda. 28 mins: Sydney don\u2019t seem in any rush to add to their lead, passing it around in their own half. Can\u2019t really blame them. It\u2019s not exactly the gung-ho, attacking flair game the fans love but it\u2019s effective and with this Mariners defence, you always sense they\u2019ll get a few more clear chances without pushing too hard to look for them. 26 mins: Solid defending from Rose to cut out a throughball to Bobo. If that had gone past him it would have been Kenny Loggins time. 25 mins: Bingham fails to connect with a deep cross into the box from Appiah, to be fair he was under pressure from Grant. Have I been too quick to write-off the Mariners? They\u2019re looking a little more competitive. Let\u2019s hope they can make a game of this. 22 mins: It\u2019s a poor ball in, overhit by Galloway, but the Mariners fight to win a corner out of it. A bit better from the visitors. The corner comes to nothing but the last few minutes have been their best so far. 21 mins: Only the most one-eyed Mariners fan would have backed the side before this game, and on the evidence of the opening exchanges I\u2019d suggest little has changed. They\u2019ve had a fair bit of possession but in non-dangerous areas. When Sydney go forward, they always look like they might score. The Mariners get a free-kick off Grant though. This is a chance to cause some chaos in the box. 18 mins: Well the gas has gone out of the game for a spell... probably not the worst thing in the world as far as the Mariners are concerned, it could have been over in half an hour if Sydney had kept the pressure up. I\u2019m slightly worried about the pending award of the league title (Premiers Plate not being part of me lexicon) to Sydney. Having spent the season having them lauded as, potentially, the greatest side in A League side of all time. They aren\u2019t. The majority of the time they play an overly aggressive, visually moribund game of attrition. A little like the German side in Escape to Victory. Phil Withall via email The German side from Escape to Victory? You\u2019ve made some valid/defensible points but egads that\u2019s harsh. 13 mins: A great ball by Brillante sends Grant away on the right but the Mariners defend it well. They\u2019ll need more of that if they\u2019re going to get back into this. 11 mins: Another chance for Sydney but Necevski is equal to the shot. This is not looking good for the Mariners, Sydney have carved them open several times already. 10 mins: Ferreira gets a ball into the chest and goes down in agony. He should be able to shake that off though... and indeed he\u2019s running around a minute later. 8 mins: It begins! Zullo with a fantastic cross into the box, curling it right into the path of Holosko, who fires home. Great ball, great run, great finish. No chance Necevski. 7 mins: Well that almost went against the script, O\u2019Donovan setting up Appiah but he can\u2019t get his shot past Vuck in the Sydney goal 5 mins: Sydney making most of the early running. No surprises there. The ball has barely been out of the Mariners half so far. Here come the visitors with a foray though, winning a free-kick and knocking it around the halfway mark. They\u2019ve put their foot on the ball and are playing it around well. Should settle their nerves. For now at least. 3 mins: OOOooo! Buijs comes inside of Roux, and curls it just over the bar. Great pass by Grant to find him. Early warning sign for Central Coast. Peeeeeep! And we\u2019re off. This could be a long 90 minutes for the Mariners... or it could be the launchpad for fairytale turnaround that jumpstarts their finals campaign. Can\u2019t see the latter happening though I must admit. Slow start so far. As you can tell by my rambling. Kick-off looming. The Cove in good voice as the Sky Blues get ready in the centre circle. Bit harsh, I\u2019ve always found it quite endearing. And if they\u2019re sacrificial lambs for Sydney tonight, would that make them the Laminators? Now that does sound daft. Despite their position on the ladder, the Mariners haven\u2019t been hammered too many times this season... but they won\u2019t need reminding that their biggest loss came in this fixture back in October, just when the Sky Blues steamroller was hitting top gear. Necevski in particular won\u2019t want to see that last goal again. So here it is. Before this gets in danger of becoming too silly. Here are tonight\u2019s line-ups. It looks ominous for that Mariners defence. Bear with me on this, but tonight\u2019s match feels a bit like the opening scene of Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, starring Graham Arnold as Indy, Kevin Muscat\u2019s head as a giant rolling boulder and the Premiers Plate as that melted World Cup-looking thing on a weight-sensitive plinth, which will be triggered if Sydney get things wrong tonight. Because even if Muscat\u2019s rolling head gives Indy-Arnie a brief scare, we all know he\u2019ll come good in the end. And you can bet that old rascal Arnie will be celebrating long into the night if they do win the Plate this weekend. Right Arnie? Not a chance, no chance. That\u2019s what other teams want. The other teams want us to celebrate and take our foot off the pedal and that\u2019s not going to happen. It\u2019s about driving this team to be better and better and we know we\u2019ve still got a lot left in us. Graham Arnold So here we are folks, the race is almost run, the chequered flag is in sight and Sydney FC are so close to snatching the Premiers Plate you can almost hear the drip, drip, drip of Graham Arnold salivating. The fat lady hasn\u2019t sung just yet, but Adele is in town so if she shoves a couple of cushions up her jumper she can fill in while we wait. The equation for Sydney fans is simple enough. A win against the Mariners today and a slip by Victory tomorrow will be enough to seal the minor premiership - not that there\u2019s any real doubt they\u2019ll claim it at some stage anyway.

      "bodyText": "What is the extent of foreign political donations in Australia? A parliamentary inquiry into foreign donations has recommended banning donations to political parties, although members of the committee disagreed on whether the ban should extend to third parties involved in political campaigning. The recommendation from the inquiry is: ... a prohibition on donations from foreign citizens and foreign entities to Australian registered political parties, associated entities and third parties. This ban would not apply to dual Australian citizens either in Australia or overseas, or to non-Australian permanent residents in Australia. This could prevent donations such as the $250,000 given to the Liberal party by Lord Michael Ashcroft, a British Conservative peer, in 2013, or the $850,000 given to the Labor party by Chinese-based Zi Chun Wang in 2013 (assuming that neither are Australian citizens, as they have not given an Australian address in their donation declarations). However, it\u2019s not yet clear how it would work with a donor such as businessman Chau Chak Wing, who is an Australian citizen but has used a Hong Kong-based company to make donations; or a company that is listed both in Australia and overseas, such as BHP Billiton; or companies with significant local operations that are ultimately foreign-owned. So how much have foreign donors given to our political parties over the years? Here we\u2019ve examined donation declarations on the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s website, identifying donors that are listed at a non-Australian address. As the address is not always listed on the analysis part of the site, and addresses need to be checked in each individual donation declaration, we\u2019ve limited the analysis to the financial years 2010-11, 2013-14, and 2015-16, which mostly cover the past three federal elections. We\u2019ve also had to limit it to donations over the disclosure threshold, and that are categorised as \u201cdonations\u201d by the parties themselves (as opposed to \u201cother receipts\u201d): The list is dominated by China-based donors, with 14 of the 21 either based in mainland China or Hong Kong.

The child abuse royal commission also heard that there were 1,006 alleged perpetrators of abuse within the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, but the congregation did not report a single one to police. The Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, the inquiry heard, were still refusing to change a second century biblical rule requiring two witnesses to prove wrongdoing. The royal commission returned to its examination of the Uniting church and the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses on Friday, seeking to understand how each had reformed its handling of child protection and abuse complaints. Counsel assisting, Angus Stewart, SC, said the royal commission had analysed data provided by the Uniting church on 2,504 child abuse complaints since 1977. Of those allegations, 133 related to abuse that occurred in places of worship. The church had paid out about $17.5m to survivors, and had been the subject of 255 civil claims, Stewart said. The royal commission is exploring how the church\u2019s complicated structure is affecting its ability to have consistent child protection measures and complaint handling mechanisms. The Uniting church has 1,065,000 members, making it the third largest Christian denomination in Australia. It has 40,000 employees and 30,000 volunteers, and runs 64 schools and 179 agencies providing services to children, youth, or the broader community. It is governed by a series of non-hierarchical councils, including the assembly, known as the national council, and state and territory synods, regional presbyteries, and individual congregations. The national assembly develops and promotes child safety policy and codes of conduct, but each of the various councils are responsible for implementing them. The church has developed a national child safe policy framework, which is modelled on recommendations from the royal commission. That framework was approved last weekend. The royal commission chair, Justice Peter McClellan, asked whether the church had used its considerable following to influence the federal government on implementing a national redress scheme. The Uniting church president, Stuart McMillan, said churches had far less influence than they did in the 1950s and 60s. But McMillan said the church was helping to encourage governments to commit to the scheme. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly doing that your honour, I have facilitated meetings of our ecumenical partners to have conversations about redress and about redress schemes,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cWe had a meeting with the commonwealth only in January to talk about matters that needed to be explored if they are going to go ahead with the scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly goodwill on the part of churches on this matter.\u201d Earlier, the royal commission heard evidence about the extent of abuse within the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. It heard there were at least 1,008 survivors of alleged abuse, and 579 Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses members confessed. About 400 alleged perpetrators were expelled from the congregation, and 230 later reinstated. The royal commission reported 514 perpetrators to police. It also heard victims were still shunned if they left the organisation. The Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Australia consider that they are prohibited by scripture from altering the application of a two-witness rule that applies in all cases of complaints of wrongdoing, the royal commission heard. The commission found the organisation wrongly relied on that rule in the context of child sexual abuse, saying complainants were subject to ongoing traumatisation if their allegation wasn\u2019t corroborated by a confession by their abuser or a second \u201ccredible\u201d eyewitness. Stewart said the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses had failed to address many of the inquiry\u2019s recommendations, including that they revise or modify the application of that rule. He said the organisation had also failed to address the particularly devastating practice of shunning victims who disassociated from the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses because their abuser remained in the congregation, while maintaining it was not a policy. The commission found the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses did not respond adequately to child sexual abuse complaints and did not adequately protect children from the risk of being abused. But senior members of the Australian church dispute the commission\u2019s finding that the organisation has a general practice of not reporting child sexual abuse allegations to police or authorities unless required to do so by law. \u201cWe have never had a practice of not reporting,\u201d Jehovah\u2019s Witness Australian branch committee member Terrence O\u2019Brien told the commission on Friday. O\u2019Brien said hundreds were reported, although not by the organisation because it was left to the elders handling the case or the parents. The commission heard the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses had referred 15 of 17 child abuse allegations to police that had arisen since the commission hearings, noting that in two cases the adult survivors did not want it reported. Rodney Spinks, who advises church elders on how to handle child sexual abuse cases, said victims or their parents were told they had the absolute right to report abuse to authorities and that the elders would fully support them.",

Park, who took office in 2013, is the most prominent figure in a wide-ranging corruption and cronyism scandal that has gripped South Korea since last autumn. She and her longtime confidante, Choi Soon-sil, are accused of conspiring to pressure companies to donate large sums to two nonprofit foundations Choi set up. Samsung, by far the country\u2019s most famous company, is among those that donated close to US$70m. Park\u2019s presidential powers were suspended in December after parliament\u2019s impeachment vote, which the constitutional court on Friday made the unanimous decision to uphold. Park admitted behaving \u201cnaively\u201d in her relationship with Choi, but denies coercing companies. She has also denied claims that she granted her friend, who does not have security clearance, unlawful access to state affairs, and allowed her to influence policy, including Seoul\u2019s stance on North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. The court thought differently: \u201cPark concealed completely Choi\u2019s meddling in state affairs and denied it whenever suspicions over the act emerged and even criticised those who raised the suspicions,\u201d it said in its ruling. What happens next in South Korea? South Korea must elect a new president within 60 days at a time of widespread anger at the state of the economy, and the influence wielded by its political and industrial elites. The consensus among local media is that voters will elect her successor on 9 May. South Korea\u2019s prime minister, Hwang Kyo-ahn, who was appointed acting president after the national assembly\u2019s impeachment vote, will continue in that role until the election. Millions of anti-Park voters will be hoping that the scandal acts as a catalyst for sweeping domestic reforms to rein in the political influence of the chaebol, South Korea\u2019s family-run conglomerates. The acting head of Samsung is already on trial in connection with donations the firm made to Choi\u2019s foundations, but there are mounting calls for other tycoons to face legal action. And across the region? Friday\u2019s ruling comes at a time of increasing tension on the Korean peninsula and in the wider Asia-Pacific region. Park took a hard line against North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme, in contrast to some of her predecessors who believed engagement was the only way to persuade Pyongyang. Park succeeded in forging closer ties with China, but relations soured after South Korea agreed to deploy a US missile defence system intended to counter the growing threat from the North. Beijing says the Thaad system represents a threat to its own security and has called for it to be cancelled. The veteran liberal politician Moon Jae-in is potentially the greatest beneficiary of current public anger towards Park and her ruling Saenuri party. Moon, who has a comfortable lead in the race to succeed Park, has called for the missile defence system to be \u201creconsidered\u201d, and would be expected to seek dialogue with Pyongyang. A Moon presidency could come too late to repair relations with Beijing: officials in Washington and Seoul say Thaad could be up and running as early as next month. Whoever wins the election, the priority will be to bring a semblance of stability to South Korean politics and begin the difficult task of uniting a country that has become bitterly divided by the scandal. What next for Park Geun-hye? Aside from ending her presidency just under a year before her five-year term was due to expire in February 2018, the court\u2019s ruling means Park loses the immunity to criminal indictment. Now she is no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. She now has a nervous wait to discover whether she will face criminal proceedings.

On Thursday, Lyndon Rive, Tesla\u2019s vice-president for energy products, told the AFR the company could install the 100-300 megawatt hours of battery storage that would be required to prevent the power shortages that have been causing price spikes and blackouts in the state.

The most recent blackout was in early February the Australian Energy Market Operator said there were many factors behind it, including higher demand than anticipated. Grid scale battery storage could help to even out price spikes, prevent blackouts and improve reliability across the network.

The Northern Territory government will also investigate the leak and has refused to guarantee the journalist\u2019s phone records will not be accessed. Late on Thursday Sky News published a letter, reportedly written by former juvenile detainee Dylan Voller, which listed a number of guards and other inmates under a heading \u201cpeople to kill\u201d and various ways in which he could kill them. According to the report, Voller wrote the list while he was detained at Don Dale juvenile corrections facility, but it does not say when. Voller has been in and out of detention since the age of 11. The list is among thousands of pieces of evidence given to the commission. At a directions hearing on Friday morning commissioner Margaret White, sitting alongside co-commissioner Mick Gooda, demanded answers from lawyers about the source of the leak. \u201cCommissioner Gooda and I are disturbed about the leak and we would like to get to the bottom of who has provided the news agencies with the documents,\u201d White said. \u201cIt appears to be in breach of all the undertakings that have been given by the parties with respect to documents.\u201d White said the document would have been in the possession of the NT government, which was the \u201cconduit through whom all those documents come to the commission\u201d.

While the document may have originated with the NT government, it had also since been provided to the commission, she said. \u201cI\u2019m not making anything of that other than we\u2019re not the only ones who hold the document,\u201d she said. Brownhill agreed to inquire with the NT Department of Corrections at the direction of the commissioners. Counsel assisting the commission, Peter Callaghan SC, observed that the list pictured in the media reports did not appear in the same form that it was given to the commission. On Friday afternoon the NT attorney general, Natasha Fyles, said there would be an investigation into the leak, and refused to guarantee that the Sky News journalist\u2019s phone records would not be accessed. It is the second leak of documents related to the department of corrections, after a full unredacted copy of the critical Hamburger report was leaked last year. No investigation was launched at the time. \u201cI think we need to respect in the Northern Territory that we have hard-working journalists and they in their roles have processes, and we need to, as a government respect that,\u201d Fyles said. \u201cThis is not about a witch hunt, this is just making sure that in relation to the commissioner\u2019s comment, that we look into the matter.\u201d When asked if she could guarantee phone records would not be accessed, Fyles said: \u201cOn the surface I can say no. \u201cObviously police may have different feelings on that, but I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s at that level yet,\u201d she said. In 2010 a Darwin journalist lodged a complaint with the NT ombudsman over police accessing his records to find the source of a story about a raid on the house of the then lord mayor. Peter O\u2019Brien, who represents Voller, told Guardian Australia if the leak came from the corrections department or employees it constituted a continuation of the mistreatment of juvenile detainees, \u201cusing the brutality of lawyers, and using the brutality of the press\u201d. He said the report, which he was not aware of until publication, was \u201ccontemptuous\u201d and believed the journalist should be questioned and reveal his source. O\u2019Brien said he also supported the potential accessing of the journalist\u2019s phone records. Voller had been identified as a vulnerable witness, O\u2019Brien said, and the leak came at a time when his rehabilitation was fragile and while he had been \u201cdoing his best to get on with life in a meaningful way\u201d. O\u2019Brien said during Friday\u2019s hearing his client was \u201cextremely disturbed\u201d by the leak. \u201cIt has tremendous potential obviously, to not only prejudice him and besmirch his character in these proceedings, but also jeopardises his chances of rehabilitation.\u201d Voller, who has been serving a three year and eight month sentence on convictions related to an aggravated robbery, was last month released on bail to the Alice Springs rehabilitation camp Bush Mob. Friday\u2019s hearing comes as the royal commission prepares to hold its fourth set of public hearing next week in Alice Springs. The NT government is expected to provide responses to testimony delivered by Voller in a December public hearing, and by another juvenile witness in a closed session. The commission will hear evidence from a number of other vulnerable witnesses, as well as former and current corrections and youth justice staff. Derek Tasker, the guard who was found not guilty of assault over his treatment of Voller, is among the witnesses scheduled to appear, as is the current NT minister Gerry McCarthy. McCarthy was the corrections minister in the former Labor government when a number of the alleged incidents of mistreatment of juvenile detainees occurred, but has previously said he had not seen the footage which aired on the ABC. He also oversaw the controversial commissioning and construction of the $1.8bn adult prison.",

      "bodyText": "When I was 15, I told my parents I was staying at a friend\u2019s house after my KFC shift finished but what I really did was hitch a ride 30km down the road and attended the Port Fairy folk festival. Sadly, my cover was shabby. This was before mobile phones \u2013 and I hadn\u2019t told my friend I was pretending to stay over at her house. Dumb! She rang my parents looking for me. \u201cIsn\u2019t she at your house?\u201d they asked. Everyone who\u2019s been a teenager ever and broken their parents hearts knows the car feeling. The car feeling is when you\u2019ve just been caught doing something TERRIBLE and you are going home in the car with your parents after the fact. I\u2019d rather go home in the back of a divvy van. The atmosphere is as thick as soup. It\u2019s all there: rage, indignation, shame, disappointment, anxiety. I tried to invoke the Footloose defence: \u201cThere\u2019s a time to weep. There\u2019s a time to mourn. And there is a time to dance. And this is our time!\u201d But \u2013 just like a kid in a 1980s teen movie \u2013 I was grounded. And folk music never sounded the same. (I still can\u2019t listen to Kev Carmody to this day without a shiver.) Since pagan time, festivals have exerted an almost spooky lure. Like the mermaids who sing to sailors, we\u2019re drawn to the noise coming from a far-off field. Why else do sensible adults pay hundreds of dollars to pitch a tent in a muddy field and eat $16 paella from a cardboard box? Why would teenagers run away from home, climb under fences and dance with strangers? It\u2019s not because they\u2019re into folk music. We pretend they\u2019re a cultural experience, at one remove from our essential selves, but festivals are really conduits of joy. They\u2019re one of those sanctioned spaces where we go all Footloose, at any age. I\u2019m talking about dancing for days, talking to strangers, lying on a blanket in the sun all afternoon listening to some band you\u2019ve never heard of, but whose music you\u2019re going to buy later. I am writing this from Adelaide, where the city is in the middle of festival fever. It\u2019s Adelaide Festival and fringe festival time. Last weekend was the car race, Clipsal 500, and Adelaide writers\u2019 week; this weekend it\u2019s Womadelaide. The entire city is demob happy. Thursday night was warm and the streets and gardens were packed with people leaving one event and going to the next. Music drifted from \u2026 somewhere. People seemed happy. Come the weekend, the centre of Adelaide will be so packed that we\u2019ll be walking on the road and strangers will be swapping tips about what great music or acts they\u2019ve just seen. This is how it should be all the time, I\u2019ll say to people. Adelaide in March is our Utopian ideal. I used to wonder why Adelaide jammed everything into one month. Why not spread it out thinly across the calendar like low-cal margarine so a little bit of this joy can be tasted for longer? But then after speaking to a few of the city\u2019s bigwigs last year it was apparent that they were deliberately aiming for this heady mix of EVERYTHING FUN AT ONCE. Rob Brookman, a former artistic director of the Adelaide festival and a founder of Womadelaide said it wasn\u2019t realistic to replicate the joyful festival feeling for long periods of time. \u201cPeople find it hard to remain in love 12 months of the year \u2013 you can only be ecstatic for a short period,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe phenomenon of the audience coming out at unprecedented levels in February and March \u2013 you cannot sustain that for 12 months. And one should not want to or hope to; there is something glorious about a month where culture takes centre stage. You want people to feel like it\u2019s something special.\u201d And it is special.

And the folk festival I ran away to as a teenager is still going strong, now in its 41st year. Despite so many technological innovations, there\u2019s still a hunger for this old thing, this collective joy, this permission to just let go. Kate Ellis shows why politics needs to change It\u2019s depressing that someone of the calibre of Kate Ellis has to quit politics because of family commitments. It shows we need to think about reforming the job so that it is truly representative. We need men and women, with a variety of situations and backgrounds, in the house representing our interests.

The prime minister said on Facebook he and his wife Lucy had known Leak for more than 30 years and he was \u201calways a good humoured sceptic of anybody and anything in authority\u201d. Turnbull praised Leak as \u201ca fine painter ... especially of portraits\u201d as well as a political cartoonist. \u201cWho had more life, more energy than him?

They would follow me and they would keep singing, and I got addicted to them.\u201d</p> <p>The intensity of this experience led Abel to arrange funding to create a theatre show with Manganiyar music at its core. This project became the highly acclaimed Manganiyar Seduction, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/30/womad-festival-review\">wowed Australian audiences when it toured in 2012</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI just found something very deep inside me being touched by this whole experience,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then travelling to all these villages, and meeting them and their families ... spending night-long sessions with them \u2013 it just became a different journey.\u201d That journey was a long one: The Manganiyar Seduction \u2013 a \u201cstructured composition\u201d with a spectacular visual design \u2013 took three years to make. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7549e60f5efb7da0c73003853b6a5dbf9ba80b3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7549e60f5efb7da0c73003853b6a5dbf9ba80b3d/0_0_3971_3425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manganiyar Classroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"863\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The musical traditions the Manganiyar children have inherited are not easily incorporated into the strict structure of the Indian education system.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This time around, Abel has focused on the talents and experiences of Manganiyar children, and the politics of education. </p> <p>\u201cThis one is a production where the kids question the government education system that they\u2019re subjected to,\u201d he says. </p> <p>\u201cWhat we talk about is the homogenisation of education.

But here we\u2019re talking about a whole community, a whole tribe of musicians. Where is the place for them to flourish?\u201d</p> <p>The influence of the market, which is not kind to things like tradition or heritage, coupled with the inflexibility of their children\u2019s schooling, means the Manganiyar musical traditions are under threat. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c8b00ee811bac2d75dfeb622d0740f00687f393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c8b00ee811bac2d75dfeb622d0740f00687f393/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manganiyar Classroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Manganiyar Classroom: where kids question the education system, and music prevails.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve all been told that going to school and getting an education gives you a better future.

They would follow me and they would keep singing, and I got addicted to them.\u201d The intensity of this experience led Abel to arrange funding to create a theatre show with Manganiyar music at its core. This project became the highly acclaimed Manganiyar Seduction, which wowed Australian audiences when it toured in 2012. \u201cI just found something very deep inside me being touched by this whole experience,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then travelling to all these villages, and meeting them and their families ... spending night-long sessions with them \u2013 it just became a different journey.\u201d That journey was a long one: The Manganiyar Seduction \u2013 a \u201cstructured composition\u201d with a spectacular visual design \u2013 took three years to make. This time around, Abel has focused on the talents and experiences of Manganiyar children, and the politics of education. \u201cThis one is a production where the kids question the government education system that they\u2019re subjected to,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat we talk about is the homogenisation of education. We have an education system [in India] which is the same for kids in the villages, kids in the cities, kids with special talents, without talent.\u201d The Manganiyar children are the first generation of people in their villages to go to school, and the musical traditions they have inherited are not easily incorporated into the strict structure of the Indian education system. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a thought to how we can actually get the best of these super-talented children,\u201d Abel says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very important, especially when you have a demographic of extremely talented children, where there is the potential of actually achieving greatness in the field of music, in the field of arts.\u201d It\u2019s common knowledge, says Abel, that for musicians, \u201clife is a struggle unless you really make it. But here we\u2019re talking about a whole community, a whole tribe of musicians. Where is the place for them to flourish?\u201d The influence of the market, which is not kind to things like tradition or heritage, coupled with the inflexibility of their children\u2019s schooling, means the Manganiyar musical traditions are under threat. \u201cThey\u2019ve all been told that going to school and getting an education gives you a better future. [Members of the community are] all putting their children into schools for other vocations, for other careers. So as a community, the amount of musicians coming out every year is dwindling.\u201d Abel worries about the long-term impact this will have on the music. \u201cEverybody wants the tradition to be alive. But then how do you actually keep that tradition alive? It\u2019s not by keeping them within the existing framework. You\u2019ve got to find new ways.\u201d In this respect, Abel is putting his money where his mouth is: the proceeds from The Manganiyar Classroom are going towards creating specialist schools for Manganiyar children, to enable them to learn widely but in a way which allows them to continue to develop the musical traditions for which they are renowned. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to look after these traditions because it\u2019s not something that you have in every other part of the world ... It\u2019s a treasure we need to look after.\u201d \u2022 The Manganiyar Classroom is showing at Womadelaide on 10 and 11 March",

Readers in Western Australia will obviously be concerned to know whether the state government will be run by Colin Barnett or Mark McGowan after Saturday\u2019s election \u2013 but the key point of interest for the rest of us will be the performance of One Nation. Since Pauline Hanson and her small Senate posse arrived back in Canberra courtesy of the double dissolution election in 2016, One Nation has enjoyed something of a dream run. While the One Nation folks are easily slighted and are fond of hollering Fake News\u2122 at the first whiff of grapeshot, Hanson 2.0 hasn\u2019t really faced intense media pressure in its opening phase. Malcolm Turnbull and his team have tip-toed cautiously around Hanson, affording her deference, respect, and, periodically, flattery.

Joyce told reporters he knew where the country would end up if One Nation ended up running the country. \u201cI will tell you exactly where it is going to go. \u201cIt is going to go down the toilet.\u201d Turnbull had two explicit slaps at Hanson over the course of the week, one in relation to vaccinations, the other in relation to her comments about Islam. But the finest wisdom of the week emerged from Ron Boswell. If you aren\u2019t old and battle scarred enough to know who Boswell is, he was a Nationals senator for Queensland from 1983 to 2014, and led the party in the Senate from 1990 to 2007. He led the Nationals fightback against One Nation when Hanson was last in the parliament. Boswell has been stewing on the Hanson comeback for some months, politely holding his tongue. But this week, he gave his colleagues both barrels. He said if the Coalition continued to normalise Hanson, it was organising its own funeral. \u201cBecause all you are doing is legitimising people voting for her. Making it safe for people to vote for her,\u201d Boswell told my colleague Gabrielle Chan. Boswell said if you want to know how it looks and feels to have a permanent fracture in your base, just look at Labor, who have lost 10% of progressive people to the Greens. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the same position as the Labor party where they get dragged to the left all the time. If we don\u2019t fight her back that\u2019s where we\u2019ll end up.\u201d \u201cWe will be dragged to the right.\u201d Boswell is exactly right. He\u2019s not a pipe smoker, or an arm chair general, or a bobble head on Sky or ABC News 24 banging on about optics and the narrative and other mumbo jumbo \u2013 he\u2019s speaking from lived experience \u2013 dusty hands, bruised knees, the lot. What remains to be seen is whether the current generation have the clarity and the courage of the old fighter\u2019s convictions.",

      "bodyText": "A mass bleaching event is taking its toll on the Great Barrier Reef for an unprecedented second year in a row, a Queensland government agency has confirmed. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has declared widespread damage from an underwater heatwave after a single day of aerial surveys between Cairns and Townsville on Thursday. The authority\u2019s David Wachenfeld told the ABC the survey findings \u201cregrettably\u201d gave the agency enough evidence to declare another mass bleaching event, following the worst to date in 2016 which killed off 22% of coral. A repeat of mass bleaching compounds fears for the survival of already-stressed coral, whose recovery since 2016 has been challenged by stubbornly high sea surface temperatures, including through winter. The scale of bleaching will be confirmed through further surveys by the agency and reef scientists but it is likely to take at least six months before the death rate of coral is known. Wachenfeld said the agency\u2019s survey added to \u201cquite a few reports through our early warning system, the eye on the reef program\u201d. While the more remote northern section of the reef was hardest-hit last year, coral bleaching has been recently documented in areas further south more commonly visited by tourists. Photos and footage taken by marine biologist Brett Monroe Garner at a reef between Port Douglas and Cairns indicate severe bleaching of corals he said were \u201cfull of colour and life\u201d little over a month ago. Garner, who has been documenting the bleaching with Greenpeace, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been photographing this area of the reef for several years now and what we\u2019re seeing is unprecedented. \u201cIn these photos nearly 100% of the corals are bleaching and who knows how many will recover? Algae is already beginning to overgrow many of the corals. \u201cJust a few months ago, these corals were full of colour and life. Now, everywhere you look is white. The corals aren\u2019t getting the chance to bounce back from last year\u2019s bleaching event. If this is the new normal, we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d The images, released by Greenpeace on Friday, add to what the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration described last month as reports of \u201cscattered coral bleaching along a large stretch\u201d of the reef, from Mackay in the south to the far north. Wachenfeld said the extent of bleaching compared to last year was less important than the fact that \u201cthe climate is changing and that is bringing a much greater frequency of extreme weather events to the Great Barrier Reef\u201d. \u201cIn total, those extreme weather events and the overall impact of climate change is a major threat to the future of the reef.\u201d WWF oceans campaigner Richard Leck said he was \u201cshocked and saddened by what is unfolding\u201d. \u201cScientists warned that without sufficient emissions reductions we could expect annual mass bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef by 2050,\u201d he said. \u201cConsecutive bleaching events have arrived 30 years early.\u201d WWF also released footage on Monday of severely bleached coral at Vlasoff Cay near Cairns, where cinematographer Richard Fitzpatrick filmed sequences for David Attenborough\u2019s Great Barrier Reef series. \u201cVlasoff Cay used to have the best coral diversity in the area,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cNow with the water sitting at 32 degrees all the way to the bottom, the corals are dying. Many are already dead and covered in algae.\u201d \u201cThe reef is facing an imminent danger of mortality at a level that far exceeds last year over a greater geographical distance.\u201d Pictures of newly bleached coral were taken in recent weeks at Moore Reef, near Cairns, by the reef scientist Tyrone Ridgway, as well as by divers further south near Palm Island. The bleaching has prompted Terry Hughes, a leading reef scientist at James Cook University who is also with the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, to embark on a week-long aerial survey of the reef from next Wednesday. The survey will replicate one last year that drew global attention to the extent of damage to the natural wonder. He said indications from underwater thermometers were that although sea surface temperatures were lower than this time last year, they had been above average over the last year, including through winter. Bleaching occurs when warm waters prompt coral to expel algae living within their tissues, turning white. The coral may die in the six to 12 months after bleaching, meaning the level of mortality on the reef will not be determined until later in the year. The world heritage-list reef was spared an \u201cin danger\u201d listing by Unesco in 2015 but environmental groups argue it remains on the organisation\u2019s \u201cwatch list\u201d. The Australian and Queensland governments, which are obliged to show how they are jointly managing the reef\u2019s long-term conservation, acknowledge climate change is its main threat. The Queensland Labor government, which is focused on improving water quality after its bid to pass tree-clearing laws to curb emissions \u2013 a key plank of Australia\u2019s reef conservation plan \u2013 failed, has urged its federal counterpart to price carbon. However, the federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, at the start of a review of the government\u2019s climate change policies earlier this year, was forced to rule out pricing carbon after a brief internal revolt. The Greenpeace campaigner Alix Foster Vander Elst said the Australian and Queensland governments should rethink their support of the giant proposed Adani coalmine, given its potential contribution to climate change. \u201cWe have on our doorstep the clearest signal that climate change is happening, and that governments aren\u2019t moving fast enough to stop it,\u201d Elst said. \u201cTackling climate change is the only real solution here and that starts by stopping public funding for climate-killing coal projects.\u201d",

In an interview on Adelaide\u2019s 5AA radio on Friday, Turnbull used the threat of a reservation policy to put gas suppliers \u201con notice\u201d that they had to secure supply for their customers. The comments contrast with statements by the resources minister, Matt Canavan, that gas reservation would not deliver \u201ca very good outcome\u201d because rationing did not work in other markets. The Australian Workers Union has long called for reservation of gas because it would reduce power prices for industrial consumers, and Bill Shorten has called on the government to convene an emergency meeting to consider a national interest test for gas or a form of reservation policy. Last week Nationals MP Andrew Broad told Guardian Australia the government should consider reserving 15% of gas supplies rather than exporting them. Asked about the proposal for gas reservation on Friday, Turnbull said: \u201cWe will consider all measures that we need to to ensure that our energy security is assured.\u201d Turnbull said he would meet the chief executives of east coast gas companies next week. \u201cThey\u2019ve been put on notice. I need to hear from them; I will be demanding from them their explanation [on] how they will deliver security for their customers.\u201d Asked specifically about Western Australia\u2019s policy of reserving 15% of gas for domestic use, Turnbull said WA had imposed the requirement on licence conditions from the outset. \u201cWhat the gas companies would say to imposing reservation on them would be: \u2018You\u2019re changing the ground rules, we did this exploration, we built the LNG trains on the basis there would not be a constraint on what we could export.\u2019 \u201cBut clearly [energy] security is the first responsibility of every government.\u201d The comments suggest that if gas reservation were adopted Turnbull would favour making quotas a condition on new gas production operations, not imposing them on existing projects. The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has ruled out a blanket gas reservation policy but praised the Queensland government\u2019s move to reserve a specific area for development for domestic supply only. Exports of liquid natural gas have caused Australian prices to rise to international levels and restricted supply to domestic consumers. On Thursday the Australian Energy Market Operator predicted that New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia would face gas shortages from the summer of 2018-19. It said the tight domestic gas market would have flow-on effects, including rising electricity prices, that could threaten the financial viability of commercial and industrial businesses. Bill Shorten said \u201cit beggars belief\u201d Turnbull had not already acted while the gas crisis escalated. \u201cWe need to look at all viable options to secure our domestic gas supply otherwise we will lose Australian jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis includes sensible reservation options rolled out nationally, like what we\u2019ve seen in Queensland.\u201d Turnbull repeatedly attacked the South Australian Labor government for investing in renewables without backup plans, including energy storage and more baseload power. AGL Energy has said the main cause of unreliable energy supply in South Australia is \u201cdysfunction\u201d in the gas market \u2013 not too many windfarms. Turnbull blamed state Labor governments for gas supply issues, particularly Victoria\u2019s moratorium on exploration for conventional and unconventional gas.
