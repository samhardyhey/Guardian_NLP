      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison likes to tells us about the government\u2019s \u201claser-like focus\u201d on getting spending under control and \u201crepairing\u201d the federal budget. That\u2019s why he is trying to force the parliament to swallow recooked versions of Tony Abbott\u2019s welfare cuts, three years after they were tabled. It\u2019s apparently the only way we can afford the Coalition\u2019s childcare plans and possibly also decent services for the disabled and their carers under the national disability insurance scheme, although that linkage seems to come and go depending on political tactics. It\u2019s also why the government deems it necessary to push Centrelink debt recovery to the point where professional debt collectors are pursuing citizens for the tiniest amounts owed due to mistakes in calculating their entitlements, or for sums they don\u2019t even owe. But when misdirected or excessive spending is due to the government\u2019s own mistakes, or to ill-conceived policy, that searing \u201claser-like focus\u201d suddenly goes all soft and blurry. Take the release of a report by the Australian National University Centre for Water Economics this week, with the startling finding that the $5.3bn spent since 2001 on trying to reduce the amount of water extracted from the Murray-Darling basin and environmental flows had achieved almost nothing. That\u2019s $5.3 BILLION dollars \u2013 more than the proposed welfare savings, enough to pay for the NDIS \u201cshortfall\u201d \u2013 that, according to the centre\u2019s director, Prof. Quentin Grafton, has been spent with \u201cno discernible impact\u201d. For a number of complex reasons, including where we drew the starting line for the efforts to return water to the crucial river system, and the way water entitlements operate, we discover that despite all that money and all that effort and all those studies, and all that shouting and burning of expert reports in the streets of country towns, we are in fact not taking less water from the river system. Which was, of course, supposed to be the point of it all. One would expect that the politicians who oversaw those 10 years of apparently failed policy-making, which included both Labor and Liberal governments, would heed Grafton\u2019s advice to urgently \u201cstop what we\u2019re doing\u201d and conduct a proper review or audit. At the very least one would expect they would want to know how Grafton and his colleagues reached their damning conclusion. Especially since there may be an El Ni\u00f1o on the way, and a likely return to the dry or drought conditions that can devastate river ecosystems and the townships that rely on them. But on Friday Grafton told me he has had no calls. \u201cNo one has responded from any political party, no calls, no emails, no one has got in touch in any way.\u201d A tiny alleged overpayment from Centrelink and we call in the professional debt collectors, but the possible squandering of $5bn in taxpayers money? Not a peep. And then there was the recent report from the Australian National Audit Office about $3.5bn in federal government grants and concessional loans to Sydney\u2019s controversial WestConnex road. It found the Abbott government\u2019s $2bn concessional loan to the project (which the audit office says will end up imposing a net cost on taxpayers of at least $640m) did not \u201cfast-track\u201d the road \u2013 as the federal and state governments so excitedly promised \u2013 and was most likely not even necessary. The Abbott government also gave the project $500m of its promised $1.5bn in grant funding long before it was actually needed, which imposed an extra $20m in cost on the commonwealth, and both the Coalition and federal Labor made initial commitments to fund the project in 2013 (that was, you may remember, an election year) before any business case for the project was finalised, although Labor insists its promise was contingent on a plan being finalised. It\u2019s the latest example of the pattern identified in last year\u2019s Grattan Institute report, which found that much of the $28bn in cost overruns on federal and state infrastructure projects over the past 15 years could have been avoided if planning processes had been a little less reckless and politicians had refrained from promising projects before they had been subject to proper cost-benefit analysis, including in the run-up to elections. Imagine the schools and hospitals and disability services that could be paid for with $28bn. The federal government did respond to the latest WestConnex report \u2013 but not in the way one might have anticipated given that \u201claser focus\u201d on budget repair and getting the most from every taxpayer dollar. No, the major projects minister, Paul Fletcher, insisted the report had made \u201cno criticism of the project\u201d, a conclusion he reached because the auditor did not criticise the road\u2019s design and construction, being confined as he was to what Fletcher described as the \u201cvery specific and limited focus\u201d of \u201cthe approval and administration of commonwealth funding\u201d. Specific and limited, and \u2013 you might argue \u2013 very relevant. Fletcher was keen to talk about \u201cLabor\u2019s hypocrisy on WestConnex\u201d but not so much about the finding that the way the funding was handled had \u201cnot adequately protected the Australian government\u2019s financial interests\u201d. But it all passed with barely a mention because this week the politicians were choosing to fight about penalty rates \u2013 who instigated a review and who did or did not support its fundings. The furore over the competing interests of the environment and Murray Darling farm communities was last year\u2019s news, the controversies over proper process for massive infrastructure spending were not in the headlines and so could be batted away with a few quick lines in a press statement. Nowhere was there evidence of any focus \u2013 laser-like or otherwise \u2013 on serious suggestions of massive waste of public money. There was one other Audit Office report this week, which is the perfect final stop for this brief tour of the somewhat selective nature of the government\u2019s efforts on budget repair and efficient spending. The report on the management of some fraud and compliance procedures did not look at the most recent and controversial system of automated data matching that is causing so much pain and anxiety, but it did find that precursor efforts to glean savings from the welfare budget had been ineffective. Do we really need to ask why voters are utterly fed up with politics?",

Academic writing, a lot of nonfiction, even some investigative journalism, can feel impenetrable. Like a language for only a few \u2013 a kind of pervasive elitism that persists, articulated in convoluted \u201cin-knowledge\u201d that outsiders like me, born of immigrants and without higher education, cannot access. </p> <p>This often holds true for poetry, too. There have been many tomes dedicated to dead white men who are making millions as skeletons, while living women of colour toil over groundbreaking, heart-shattering work that moves in ways so visceral it is hard to remember to breathe whilst reading.</p> <p>And yet still in this country, poetry that is so enamoured of its own cleverness, and poets dazzled by their own adroitness get lauded by the establishment.</p> <p>So while I am tempted to discuss the essays of Arundhati Roy, who taught me that I could speak out with truth as my firearm; though I was tempted to talk of the ongoing impact Silvia Federici and her book Caliban and the Witch had on me \u2013 a book that made the whole history of the subjugation and oppression of women so easy to understand, so enraging and heartbreaking \u2013 I decided instead to focus on one of my favourite and one of Australia\u2019s greatest living poets: Ali Cobby Eckermann.</p> <p>Nonfiction is a huge pool, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, poetry is part of its waters. Poetry is a liquid truth \u2013 certainly to the author, but also for the reader who swims in it, often upstream. It is nonfiction insomuch as it is autobiographical \u2013 a glimpse into the writer\u2019s consciousness, access for a fleeting second into their mind. It is documentation of the inseparable personal and political. </p> <p>Poetry has the potential to pierce through the intellectual and aim straight for the heart. It can move people in ways other crafts can\u2019t. So it is with Ali Cobby Eckermann\u2019s work.</p> <h2>Dip</h2> <p><em>My mother is playing hide and seek<br />between my memory and my dreams<br />she hides amongst the Language Speakers<br />I catch glimpses of her laughing<br />no longer foetal I must arise<br />no longer prone she has arisen<br />I see a foot dip daintily<br />In a rivulet of fresh rain<br />Is it hers or is it mine?</em></p> <p>Ali Cobby Eckermann is a survivor of the stolen generations as her mother was before her. Both stolen women, their stories and histories are mirrors of the worst kind. Yet Ali talks about her two mothers being equal, both being integral to her. <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/earshot/inside-my-mother-ali-cobby-eckermann/7319198\">In an interview with the ABC she said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[My birth mother] was the first person that I saw that mirrored my face and I remember the profoundness of finally finding someone that looked like me.

All my life, I have felt like an outsider with regards to language \u2013 in a land for the elite, the white, educated, middle-to-upper classes. Academic writing, a lot of nonfiction, even some investigative journalism, can feel impenetrable. Like a language for only a few \u2013 a kind of pervasive elitism that persists, articulated in convoluted \u201cin-knowledge\u201d that outsiders like me, born of immigrants and without higher education, cannot access. This often holds true for poetry, too. There have been many tomes dedicated to dead white men who are making millions as skeletons, while living women of colour toil over groundbreaking, heart-shattering work that moves in ways so visceral it is hard to remember to breathe whilst reading. And yet still in this country, poetry that is so enamoured of its own cleverness, and poets dazzled by their own adroitness get lauded by the establishment. So while I am tempted to discuss the essays of Arundhati Roy, who taught me that I could speak out with truth as my firearm; though I was tempted to talk of the ongoing impact Silvia Federici and her book Caliban and the Witch had on me \u2013 a book that made the whole history of the subjugation and oppression of women so easy to understand, so enraging and heartbreaking \u2013 I decided instead to focus on one of my favourite and one of Australia\u2019s greatest living poets: Ali Cobby Eckermann. Nonfiction is a huge pool, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, poetry is part of its waters. Poetry is a liquid truth \u2013 certainly to the author, but also for the reader who swims in it, often upstream. It is nonfiction insomuch as it is autobiographical \u2013 a glimpse into the writer\u2019s consciousness, access for a fleeting second into their mind. It is documentation of the inseparable personal and political. Poetry has the potential to pierce through the intellectual and aim straight for the heart. It can move people in ways other crafts can\u2019t. So it is with Ali Cobby Eckermann\u2019s work. Dip My mother is playing hide and seek between my memory and my dreams she hides amongst the Language Speakers I catch glimpses of her laughing no longer foetal I must arise no longer prone she has arisen I see a foot dip daintily In a rivulet of fresh rain Is it hers or is it mine? Ali Cobby Eckermann is a survivor of the stolen generations as her mother was before her. Both stolen women, their stories and histories are mirrors of the worst kind. Yet Ali talks about her two mothers being equal, both being integral to her. In an interview with the ABC she said: [My birth mother] was the first person that I saw that mirrored my face and I remember the profoundness of finally finding someone that looked like me. Because that\u2019s what family is \u2013 we were a reflection of each other ... My adopted mum, who I have always known, and have all the childhood memories with ... she is as integral in my life, I think, in the way that I view the world. They can only be equal, my two mothers.\u201d Though Eckermann searched for her birth mother from the time she was 18, it wasn\u2019t until her 33rd year that she was able to find her \u2013 and discovered Audrey Cobby, more widely known as Audrey Kinnear, was a fierce and respected activist who still carried inconceivable guilt. The Letter Dear Mother The mission is good. The food is good. I am good. rips the page from the typewriter scrunches the page till it bleeds kicks it under the wardrobe inserts a fresh page tentatively with finger poised and types Mummy Where are you? Ali grew up with her Lutheran adoptive parents but ran away at 17 and unwittingly headed to the birthplace of her mother, at Ooldea on the Nullabor Plains, living there for two years without any idea that this was where her kin were from. I love this part of her story \u2013 that she is poetry herself, writing with her body what she eventually put to page. Ngingali (ning-ali) my mother is a granite boulder I can no longer climb nor walk around her weight is a constant reminder of myself I sit in her shadow gulls nestle in her eyes their shadows her epitaph I carry a pebble of her in my pocket It is Eckermann\u2019s continuing and consistent language of forgiveness and compassion in the face of such unimaginable trauma that truly inspires me; how she can remain fierce and grounded in all her truths and still speak and write with great humanity. When she signed my copy of her book, Inside My Mother, which contains all of these poems, she wrote: \u201cTo Candy Royalle, the language of loss is the victory\u201d. Even though we have spent a little bit of time together, I\u2019ve never had the courage to ask her exactly what she meant by that.

      "bodyText": "The 25th anniversary of the Australian incarnation of Peter Gabriel\u2019s Womad (World of Music, Arts and Dance) brings together artists from 31 countries, distilling the wide world of sound into three days and four nights of late-summer revelry in Adelaide\u2019s Botanic Park. Skank along to English ska legends the Specials, chill to Brazilian bossa nova singer Bebel Gilberto, or lindy hop to Austrian electro-swing act Parov Stelar. Beyond music, Father Bob Maguire will be hosting a multifaith panel on religion and environmental responsibility, Archie Roach will be in conversation with Indigenous actor Uncle Jack Charles, Vietnamese band Hanoi Masters are cooking up a traditional chicken salad in the Taste the World tent, and the Philip Glass Ensemble are playing a live accompaniment to a screening of 1982 environmental film Koyaanisqatsi. To get you in the mood, we\u2019ve prepared a playlist of songs by eight Womadelaide acts that are high on our to-see list. Ana Tijoux Accompanying the guts and gore of TV series Breaking Bad was a soundtrack with some killer Latin tunes. One of our favourites was rapper Ana Tijoux\u2019s 1977, both the year of her birth and an autobiographical earworm about growing up in a family of Chilean exiles in France during Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship. It was in France that Tijoux was introduced to hip-hop via the children of north African immigrants. When her family returned from exile, Tijoux discovered her own voice, rapping in Spanish about women\u2019s rights, Indigenous pride, injustice, inequality, political corruption and colonialism. Her more recent recordings have incorporated traditional Andean folk instruments \u2013 including panflutes and charangos \u2013 into her strident sound. The Hot 8 Brass Band The Specials\u2019 hit Ghost Town, which captured the social breakdown and urban decay of Thatcher\u2019s Britain, found a new lease of life about three decades on with New Orleans collective Hot 8 Brass Band. The video clip of their cover pays homage to the devastation Hurricane Katrina wreaked on their city. Fittingly, both the Specials and Hot 8 are playing this year\u2019s Womadelaide, and there\u2019s high hopes for a stage invasion during one or the other\u2019s set. Hot 8 are one of the festival\u2019s opening acts and their raucous blast of hip-hop, funk and R&amp;B make the group the perfect party starters. They\u2019ve been around for two decades and endured their unfair share of tragedy \u2013 losing four members to gun violence and illness \u2013 but they\u2019ve never lost touch with their marching band street procession roots and effortless ability to get a crowd moving. Brushy One String One man. One guitar. One string. Jamaican soulman creates a complete sound with just a low E string and how-low-can-you-go pipes. When Brushy was a youngster, he was clueless as to how to play the guitar and, strumming too hard, broke five of its strings. He stuck with what was left. His big break came with a cameo in Luciano Blotta\u2019s 2007 reggae documentary Rise Up, propelling Brushy from rural poverty to international musical sensation. As one fan wrote beneath the YouTube video for Brushy\u2019s Life is For Every Man: \u201cImagine what he could do with two strings.\u201d Gawurra It\u2019s not without reason Stanley \u201cGawurra\u201d Gaykamangu is oft compared with Gurrumul. Both are Yolngu from north-east Arnhem Land; both have voices that seem to travel across time and space; and both sing in language about connections with the land. Gawurra sings in the Gupapuyngu language, creating modern incarnations of the ancient songlines of his homeland. His debut album, Ratja Yaliyali (Vine of Love), had him take home four trophies at last year\u2019s National Indigenous Music Awards. Its title track is sheer aural beauty. Oumou Sangar\u00e9 Malian singer Oumou Sangar\u00e9, one of Africa\u2019s biggest stars, has been ruffling feathers since she burst on to the scene at the age of 21 with the 1989 album Moussoulou (Women). A tenacious advocate for women\u2019s empowerment (sparked by her father\u2019s abandonment of her pregnant mother to take a second wife when Sangar\u00e9 was a toddler), Sangar\u00e9 sings in her native Bambara and broaches taboo subjects that challenge African society\u2019s rigid conventions. Her songs often double as morality lectures; take the fast and funky Wele Wele Wintou, an admonishment of child marriage, where Sangar\u00e9 tells men their daughters shouldn\u2019t marry before they have developed breasts. Or the time she sang a song that included the lyrics \u201cpolygamy is the worst of all things\u201d for an audience that included the king of Swaziland and seven of his wives. \u201cPeople couldn\u2019t believe their ears,\u201d she told the Guardian in 2008. Sangar\u00e9 is also an ambassador for the United Nations, owns the 35-room Hotel Wasulu in Bamako, and imports a branded SUV from China \u2013 named Oum Sang after her good self. She also likes to dance \u2013 and she\u2019ll expect you to as well. Toni Childs Since pumping out hits such as I\u2019ve Got to Go Now, Many Rivers to Cross and Stop Your Fussin\u2019 in the 1980s and 90s, American singer Toni Childs has become an adopted Aussie.

Naturally, Childs is now also a yoga teacher, and will be taking a Sunday morning class at Womadelaide following on from her Saturday afternoon hit-churning performance. Orquesta T\u00edpica Fern\u00e1ndez Fierro Tango music is known for arousing passion, although rarely the kind that sparks spontaneous street protests and confrontations with police. Orquesta T\u00edpica Fern\u00e1ndez Fierro began life in the early noughties performing on the streets of Buenos Aires, where authorities\u2019 attempts to move them on were met with fierce resistance from neighbourhood tango fans. The dozen-strong collective of bandoneons, strings, voice and piano shatter the traditional Argentinian sound.

Without Aboriginal voices and families and meanings, they are just pieces of wood \u2013 just sticks without stories.\u201d</p> <p>Carty aims to connect these items with the descendants of the people who made and used them. They are the living who believe ancestral spirits are incarnate in these objects, that all of this wood, animal bone, shell, stone and fibre encompasses the history of the land and the creationist animals of a past that dwarfs by tens of thousands years the comparative minutes elapsed since colonisation.</p> <p>Melbourne-born Carty comes from an academic track at the University of Melbourne and the Australian National University. But he has been deep into the field, especially in the central deserts and Arnhem Land, and is admired for his knowledge of Indigenous art and material culture. He has done work for both the National Museum of Australia and the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/\">British Museum</a>, an institution that is facing increasing acrimony and pressure over its refusal to give back some of the items in its rich Indigenous Australian collection. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/25/the-gweagal-shield-and-the-fight-to-change-the-british-museums-attitude-to-seized-artefacts\">The Gweagal shield and the fight to change the British Museum's attitude to seized artefacts | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anyone with an eye on the Indigenous cultural space observed closely as the BM took a battering while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2015/feb/14/it-taunts-us-spiritually-the-fight-for-indigenous-relics-spirited-off-to-the-uk\">negotiating the controversy</a> enshrouding its 2015 Indigenous Australia: Enduring Civilisation <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/press_releases/2015/indigenous_australia.aspx\">exhibition in London</a>, and a later <a href=\"http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/encounters\">show at the National Museum of Australia</a> to which it loaned, and later returned to the UK, precious Aboriginal artefacts.</p> <p>For some time the South Australian Museum has been determined to modify its approach to the Indigenous peoples whose artefacts it holds, especially since the arrival of its current director, Brian Oldman, from the BM in 2014. But there can be little doubt the debate about the BM\u2019s Indigenous collection has hardened the Adelaide museum\u2019s resolve to take a global lead in connecting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people \u2013 even if that means, in Carty\u2019s words, \u201cgiving some things back\u201d.</p> <p>It is, Carty says, critical for the SAM to \u201cbe out front of, rather than struggling to catch up, to that wave\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we hope to do \u2013 show real leadership around being brave and open and honest, about the history of the museum \u2026 with Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people side by side \u2026 I came here [in 2015] to apply for the job \u2026 with an awareness of just how important the collections were from my background in anthropology and interest in Aboriginal material culture \u2026 Alice [Beale, senior collections manager/anthropology] brought me here [to the storage warehouse] as an introduction.</p> <p>\u201cAnd standing here I had a very personal and visceral sense of what I was applying for. Which was not just this job, which seemed interesting and important. But it was this responsibility that went to the heart of who I was as an Australian, and what responsibilities I understand myself to have. The whole idea of what I was applying for was transformed when I walked in here, because it became personal.\u201d </p> <h2>The \u2018up-the-guts\u2019 narrative</h2> <p>The map of continental Australia explains the museum\u2019s vast Indigenous collection, amassed over a century from its opening in 1856. From 1862 until 1911 South Australia administered the vast central/northern centre that is the Northern Territory. And the <a href=\"http://museum.wa.gov.au/\">Western Australian Museum</a> did not open until 1891, so the SAM was actively collecting in its space for 35 years. Erase the lines on the map that delineate WA and the territory from South Australia and, for a critical period of post-British invasion, Indigenous dispossession and resistance, the SAM had half the continent to collect from. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Maybe a way of holding on to stories is to give some things back</p> <footer> <cite>John Carty</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe time-depth of the collection is amazing because it goes back in time in ways that other museums don\u2019t \u2026 because the Northern Territory was part of South Australia. So we are able to tell that whole \u2018up-the-guts\u2019 narrative of the continent \u2013 exploration, settlement, conflict,\u201d Carty says.</p> <p>It\u2019s a complex, often ugly and disturbing story, of black-white war, of violent eviction from ancestral lands, of the theft of natural resources and of ongoing oppression, that manifests in stolen children, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/05/defence-force-releases-last-maralinga-ancestral-lands-to-traditional-owners\">British nuclear tests at Maralinga</a> (blackfellas were carelessly exposed while attempts were made to protect most non-Indigenous people) and the shameful scourge of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/deaths-in-custody\">deaths in custody</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e99bc0c4db86ed99ba842655f771620ff3a3a3ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e99bc0c4db86ed99ba842655f771620ff3a3a3ac/0_0_4320_5760/750.jpg\" alt=\"A \u2018pearl shell\u2019 crafted from a buffed tin lid\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A \u2018pearl shell\u2019 crafted from a buffed tin lid that was collected on the Canning stock route.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerrie Drogemuller/South Australian Musuem</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carty, meanwhile, speaks of the urgent need to \u201cinvert the power structure between museums and Indigenous people\u201d, about reconnecting owners to ancestral objects and to opening genuine discussions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people about, if needs be, returning collection material to communities.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is the model of custodianship moving forward? Is it one that keeps stuff or one that opens the doors and explores new ways of holding material, holding stories \u2013 and maybe a way of holding on to stories is to give some things back.\u201d </p> <p>But institutions like the SAM, modelled, as it is, on the empirical big daddy, the BM, aren\u2019t traditionally inclined to give stuff back. The unedifying race was always to beg, borrow or steal the most cultural material to document the decline of what was (fallaciously) thought to be, by the 20th century, the vanishment of the race.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m kind of looking forward to those conversations,\u201d Carty says. \u201cI haven\u2019t had them yet \u2026 the museum has its bricks-and-mortar kind of model and that\u2019s evolving.

Blackburn modified the club, adding four rope lashes to transform this utilitarian Indigenous object \u2013 intended for hunting or combat \u2013 into a whip.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, talk about the history of Australia in one object!\u201d Carty says. \u201cYou could build a whole exhibition about 1788 and everything after on this.\u201d</p> <p>Beale holds up a Yidindji shield, fashioned in the north Queensland rainforest. Painted in 1938 at the Mulgrave river, it depicts three species of fish and turtle \u2013 all totemic animals. Norman Tindale, the giant of South Australian anthropology who was attached to the museum for 70 years (and is still known affectionately around its halls as \u201cTinny\u201d) filmed it being painted. The <a href=\"http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/collections/information-resources/archives/tindale-dr-norman-barnett-aa-338\">legacy of Tindale</a> and his vast ethnographic collection \u2013 including hair samples, face casts, drawings and family trees \u2013 with which he \u201cmapped\u201d Aboriginal Australia \u2013 looms large here. </p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know him and I don\u2019t call him \u2018Tinny\u2019 because I feel like I have to remain objective and critical about the collectors rather than being their colleague,\u201d Carty says. \u201cIn terms of reinterpreting these collections into the future we\u2019ve got to have a level of objectivity about those things.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of what he did looks deeply ethnographic. It looks like the objectification of Aboriginal people by a whitefella \u2026 You know, a lot of these things make it look like whitefellas just documenting Aboriginal people. </p> <p>\u201cBut at the heart of it was that he was kind of working against the currents of the time, which is to say, \u2018No, Aboriginal people have been here forever \u2013 they have strong links to country, they have strong family connections, they have strong cultural mores in play.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThis is my struggle with Tindale. His legacy is really complicated. His legacy is one of the great ethnographic traditions of just vacuuming up knowledge of Aboriginal people. You can be really critical of that and I think there\u2019s a way of operating there that I\u2019d be uncomfortable with as an anthropologist today. </p> <p>\u201cBut we also need to hold it in tension with the fact of what I see every day at the museum \u2013 Aboriginal people coming in and using those collections for contemporary purposes, for contemporary politics like native title, but also for really personal stuff, whether it\u2019s stolen generations material \u2013 just finding out a little bit more about your grandfather or your great-grandfather. In a sense his legacy is one that Aboriginal people have to determine. It\u2019s not for me to say.\u201d </p> <p>We stop and look at bark paintings from the Field Islands, collected in 1887 by Captain F Carrington. They are perhaps the earliest northern barks taken by white people and were said by Charles Mountford \u2013 who also had a long association with the SAM \u2013 to represent the only remaining art of the \u201cextinct\u201d islanders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"39c59e4ff86e9f5b2b692539c582732082066194\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39c59e4ff86e9f5b2b692539c582732082066194/159_362_3206_1923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Yuendumu school doors\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Yuendumu school doors represent a turning point in the history of modern Australian Indigenous art.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: South Australian Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leaning up against a wall in a hallway not far from this vast room are the Yuendumu doors, perhaps the <a href=\"http://www.aboriginalartonline.com/regions/yuendumu-doors.php\">most significant objects in the history of modern Australian Indigenous art</a>. They represent an epoch, the 1980s, when the artists of Yuendumu began transferring their ground drawings, first to canvas and then to the doors of the local school, marking the consolidation of an enduring Warlpiri art movement. </p> <p>Why are such precious objects just leaning up against a wall?</p> <p>Beale and Carty explain that storage space is tight, so things are not always kept in ideal conditions.

They arrived just in time to prevent serious damage. For days afterwards objects were moved around as the ceiling dripped into buckets.</p> <h2>The room full of bones</h2> <p>We step into a room with several long rows of shelves.

I\u2019ve stood in a similar warehouse in Canberra where the National Museum of Australia keeps its collection of remains belonging to 500-plus Indigenous people.</p> <p>Collections such as this are a legacy of many things, largely shameful: the colonial killings of tens of thousands of Indigenous Australians, some specifically for body parts; the body snatchers who ransacked burial grounds to meet the unholy 18th, 19th and 20th century markets for Indigenous skeletons; and the imposition of modern structures \u2013 roads, railways, public swimming pools, blocks of flats \u2013 on what is, and what will always be, Indigenous land.</p> <p>Most 19th century Australian collecting institutions have amassed Indigenous body parts. Most once displayed them with pride; one of the last to stop doing so was the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra (the precursor to the National Museum) that displayed skeletal remains until the 1980s. The SAM last actively collected or displayed Indigenous remains in the 1940s, while the National Museum is at the forefront of efforts to return remains from overseas countries to their people. Both the SAM and the National Museum continue to receive Indigenous remains \u2013 but only as part of national and state repatriation processes. </p> <p>As I stand in this room filled with boxes of the dead, I\u2019m struck by \u2013 angered and emotionally unsettled by \u2013 so many anomalies. I wonder: would Australia go to greater efforts to determine the identities and find the families of non-Indigenous Australians? Would it not make the effort and spend the money for a permanent keeping place to the unknown dead if they were not Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander remains? Instructively, federal government plans to build such <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/we-need-national-keeping-place-for-lost-indigenous-remains\">a keeping place for the unidentified Indigenous dead</a> have been on hold since about 2014.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How would the average Australian feel if they couldn\u2019t bury their dead?

On the floor below and behind him are rack after rack of shelves and drawers housing tens of thousands of Australian Indigenous artefacts. There are about 5,000 spears and 3,000 boomerangs here, and hundreds upon hundreds of shields, thousands of pieces of decorative art and costume, and all sorts of curios \u2013 from the crayons the Adelaide tram driver-cum-ethnologist-cum-autodidact Charles Mountford encouraged the desert people to draw with, to a \u201cpearl shell\u201d fashioned from a buffed tin lid that was collected on the Canning stock route. It\u2019s the biggest single collection of Australian Indigenous material culture in the world. And much if it is here in storage for the South Australian Museum, Australia\u2019s second oldest \u2013 and one of its most traditional \u2013 collecting institutions. Most of it will never see the light of day in exhibitions, or be displayed in the public galleries, which are already filled to bursting with other Indigenous objects. And so these items stay in this vast aircraft hangar-like structure because of enduring empirical and colonial collection practices. That may, however, be changing quickly. Carty, the museum\u2019s 39-year-old head of anthropology, surveys the collection from up here, a red rag, potentially, to the museological conservatives who are content with orthodoxy. He shakes his head and says: \u201cThese kinds of collections are utterly meaningless without Aboriginal people attached to them. Without Aboriginal voices and families and meanings, they are just pieces of wood \u2013 just sticks without stories.\u201d Carty aims to connect these items with the descendants of the people who made and used them. They are the living who believe ancestral spirits are incarnate in these objects, that all of this wood, animal bone, shell, stone and fibre encompasses the history of the land and the creationist animals of a past that dwarfs by tens of thousands years the comparative minutes elapsed since colonisation. Melbourne-born Carty comes from an academic track at the University of Melbourne and the Australian National University. But he has been deep into the field, especially in the central deserts and Arnhem Land, and is admired for his knowledge of Indigenous art and material culture. He has done work for both the National Museum of Australia and the British Museum, an institution that is facing increasing acrimony and pressure over its refusal to give back some of the items in its rich Indigenous Australian collection. Anyone with an eye on the Indigenous cultural space observed closely as the BM took a battering while negotiating the controversy enshrouding its 2015 Indigenous Australia: Enduring Civilisation exhibition in London, and a later show at the National Museum of Australia to which it loaned, and later returned to the UK, precious Aboriginal artefacts. For some time the South Australian Museum has been determined to modify its approach to the Indigenous peoples whose artefacts it holds, especially since the arrival of its current director, Brian Oldman, from the BM in 2014. But there can be little doubt the debate about the BM\u2019s Indigenous collection has hardened the Adelaide museum\u2019s resolve to take a global lead in connecting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people \u2013 even if that means, in Carty\u2019s words, \u201cgiving some things back\u201d. It is, Carty says, critical for the SAM to \u201cbe out front of, rather than struggling to catch up, to that wave\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s what we hope to do \u2013 show real leadership around being brave and open and honest, about the history of the museum \u2026 with Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people side by side \u2026 I came here [in 2015] to apply for the job \u2026 with an awareness of just how important the collections were from my background in anthropology and interest in Aboriginal material culture \u2026 Alice [Beale, senior collections manager/anthropology] brought me here [to the storage warehouse] as an introduction. \u201cAnd standing here I had a very personal and visceral sense of what I was applying for. Which was not just this job, which seemed interesting and important. But it was this responsibility that went to the heart of who I was as an Australian, and what responsibilities I understand myself to have. The whole idea of what I was applying for was transformed when I walked in here, because it became personal.\u201d The \u2018up-the-guts\u2019 narrative The map of continental Australia explains the museum\u2019s vast Indigenous collection, amassed over a century from its opening in 1856. From 1862 until 1911 South Australia administered the vast central/northern centre that is the Northern Territory. And the Western Australian Museum did not open until 1891, so the SAM was actively collecting in its space for 35 years. Erase the lines on the map that delineate WA and the territory from South Australia and, for a critical period of post-British invasion, Indigenous dispossession and resistance, the SAM had half the continent to collect from. \u201cThe time-depth of the collection is amazing because it goes back in time in ways that other museums don\u2019t \u2026 because the Northern Territory was part of South Australia. So we are able to tell that whole \u2018up-the-guts\u2019 narrative of the continent \u2013 exploration, settlement, conflict,\u201d Carty says. It\u2019s a complex, often ugly and disturbing story, of black-white war, of violent eviction from ancestral lands, of the theft of natural resources and of ongoing oppression, that manifests in stolen children, British nuclear tests at Maralinga (blackfellas were carelessly exposed while attempts were made to protect most non-Indigenous people) and the shameful scourge of deaths in custody. Carty, meanwhile, speaks of the urgent need to \u201cinvert the power structure between museums and Indigenous people\u201d, about reconnecting owners to ancestral objects and to opening genuine discussions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people about, if needs be, returning collection material to communities. \u201cWhat is the model of custodianship moving forward? Is it one that keeps stuff or one that opens the doors and explores new ways of holding material, holding stories \u2013 and maybe a way of holding on to stories is to give some things back.\u201d But institutions like the SAM, modelled, as it is, on the empirical big daddy, the BM, aren\u2019t traditionally inclined to give stuff back. The unedifying race was always to beg, borrow or steal the most cultural material to document the decline of what was (fallaciously) thought to be, by the 20th century, the vanishment of the race. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m kind of looking forward to those conversations,\u201d Carty says. \u201cI haven\u2019t had them yet \u2026 the museum has its bricks-and-mortar kind of model and that\u2019s evolving. And maybe our responsibilities lie not just in keeping stuff safe within our walls but also in keeping things safe behind other people\u2019s walls or other people\u2019s ideas of walls \u2013 which might be country or it might be local community museums.\u201d As we talk, we wander among the shelves and Alice Beale retrieves a few of the innumerable items she and Carty find compelling and intriguing. One is an Eora man\u2019s wooden club. It was collected by Lieutenant David Blackburn who arrived on the first fleet ship Supply on 18 January 1788. Blackburn modified the club, adding four rope lashes to transform this utilitarian Indigenous object \u2013 intended for hunting or combat \u2013 into a whip. \u201cI mean, talk about the history of Australia in one object!\u201d Carty says. \u201cYou could build a whole exhibition about 1788 and everything after on this.\u201d Beale holds up a Yidindji shield, fashioned in the north Queensland rainforest. Painted in 1938 at the Mulgrave river, it depicts three species of fish and turtle \u2013 all totemic animals. Norman Tindale, the giant of South Australian anthropology who was attached to the museum for 70 years (and is still known affectionately around its halls as \u201cTinny\u201d) filmed it being painted. The legacy of Tindale and his vast ethnographic collection \u2013 including hair samples, face casts, drawings and family trees \u2013 with which he \u201cmapped\u201d Aboriginal Australia \u2013 looms large here. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him and I don\u2019t call him \u2018Tinny\u2019 because I feel like I have to remain objective and critical about the collectors rather than being their colleague,\u201d Carty says. \u201cIn terms of reinterpreting these collections into the future we\u2019ve got to have a level of objectivity about those things. \u201cA lot of what he did looks deeply ethnographic. It looks like the objectification of Aboriginal people by a whitefella \u2026 You know, a lot of these things make it look like whitefellas just documenting Aboriginal people. \u201cBut at the heart of it was that he was kind of working against the currents of the time, which is to say, \u2018No, Aboriginal people have been here forever \u2013 they have strong links to country, they have strong family connections, they have strong cultural mores in play.\u2019 \u201cThis is my struggle with Tindale. His legacy is really complicated. His legacy is one of the great ethnographic traditions of just vacuuming up knowledge of Aboriginal people. You can be really critical of that and I think there\u2019s a way of operating there that I\u2019d be uncomfortable with as an anthropologist today. \u201cBut we also need to hold it in tension with the fact of what I see every day at the museum \u2013 Aboriginal people coming in and using those collections for contemporary purposes, for contemporary politics like native title, but also for really personal stuff, whether it\u2019s stolen generations material \u2013 just finding out a little bit more about your grandfather or your great-grandfather. In a sense his legacy is one that Aboriginal people have to determine. It\u2019s not for me to say.\u201d We stop and look at bark paintings from the Field Islands, collected in 1887 by Captain F Carrington. They are perhaps the earliest northern barks taken by white people and were said by Charles Mountford \u2013 who also had a long association with the SAM \u2013 to represent the only remaining art of the \u201cextinct\u201d islanders. Leaning up against a wall in a hallway not far from this vast room are the Yuendumu doors, perhaps the most significant objects in the history of modern Australian Indigenous art. They represent an epoch, the 1980s, when the artists of Yuendumu began transferring their ground drawings, first to canvas and then to the doors of the local school, marking the consolidation of an enduring Warlpiri art movement. Why are such precious objects just leaning up against a wall? Beale and Carty explain that storage space is tight, so things are not always kept in ideal conditions. Last year the pair and others rushed to the warehouse during a terrible Adelaide storm to find water dripping on to the Yuendumu doors and other objects. They arrived just in time to prevent serious damage. For days afterwards objects were moved around as the ceiling dripped into buckets. The room full of bones We step into a room with several long rows of shelves. Each row contains hundreds of cardboard boxes, some stacked four and five deep. The boxes read JAW, FEMUR, RIBS, SKULL. The bodies or body parts of some 5,000 Indigenous Australians are kept in this room. When we walk in Carty nods, says nothing. He leans against the bench at the back, legs crossed, arms folded across his chest. There is so much to be said about these remains, how they were acquired, why they are still here. I\u2019ve written thousands upon thousands of words about Australia\u2019s \u2013 and the world\u2019s \u2013 appalling trade in Indigenous Australian body parts. I\u2019ve stood in a similar warehouse in Canberra where the National Museum of Australia keeps its collection of remains belonging to 500-plus Indigenous people. Collections such as this are a legacy of many things, largely shameful: the colonial killings of tens of thousands of Indigenous Australians, some specifically for body parts; the body snatchers who ransacked burial grounds to meet the unholy 18th, 19th and 20th century markets for Indigenous skeletons; and the imposition of modern structures \u2013 roads, railways, public swimming pools, blocks of flats \u2013 on what is, and what will always be, Indigenous land. Most 19th century Australian collecting institutions have amassed Indigenous body parts. Most once displayed them with pride; one of the last to stop doing so was the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra (the precursor to the National Museum) that displayed skeletal remains until the 1980s. The SAM last actively collected or displayed Indigenous remains in the 1940s, while the National Museum is at the forefront of efforts to return remains from overseas countries to their people. Both the SAM and the National Museum continue to receive Indigenous remains \u2013 but only as part of national and state repatriation processes. As I stand in this room filled with boxes of the dead, I\u2019m struck by \u2013 angered and emotionally unsettled by \u2013 so many anomalies. I wonder: would Australia go to greater efforts to determine the identities and find the families of non-Indigenous Australians? Would it not make the effort and spend the money for a permanent keeping place to the unknown dead if they were not Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander remains? Instructively, federal government plans to build such a keeping place for the unidentified Indigenous dead have been on hold since about 2014. I once helped remove the body of an Australian world war one veteran from a drainage ditch on the European western front before a bulldozer, engaged in repair work, filled it in again. Extensive efforts were made to identify him. He was later buried in one of those serene commonwealth cemeteries of neat blond stone and clipped rosemary and hebe and endless lark song that dot the countryside of French and Flemish Flanders. \u201cThere is a disconnect in the Australian psyche between our respect for what happened in overseas theatres of war and the structural silence on the conflicts with Aboriginal people here,\u201d Carty says. \u201cWe pretend Australian identity was forged in conflicts overseas when in truth it was founded on conflicts right here. \u201cYou see that in the disparity between how we treat the dead. Australia will spend millions of dollars repatriating or relocating the remains of a digger in Europe, while Aboriginal people in Australia have to fight to get tiny amounts of money to rebury their ancestors, thousands of whom languish in Australian museums. \u201cHow would the average Australian feel if they couldn\u2019t bury their dead? It\u2019s unthinkable. Or it should be unthinkable. We wouldn\u2019t accept it for an Anzac. We shouldn\u2019t ask Aboriginal people to accept it either.\u201d \u2018Yeah, come on in \u2013 see the canoe\u2019 Last year Michael Young, a Mildura-based Barkindji man with relatives scattered over ancestral lands across New South Wales, contacted the SAM on behalf of some of his elders. A May 2016 history about the Pooncarie mission and school pictured a woman, Nan Nelly, and her two girls \u2013 Ivy and Maggie Johnston \u2013 in a bark canoe on the Darling river near Avoca. The photograph was taken some time before 1904, when a Mr DH Cudmore donated the canoe and the photograph to the museum. \u201cWe saw the photo and Aunt Lottie [Maggie\u2019s daughter] recognised the people in the photograph and so we knew it was our family and our canoe,\u201d Young says. \u201cAnd we found out the canoe was in the museum. \u201cBut we\u2019d never had much joy with museums \u2013 never made to feel especially welcome. You know, security were always a bit overzealous when the black people come in to see their things. \u201cSo it was surprising. John [Carty] said, \u2018Yeah, come on in \u2013 see the canoe.\u2019 We had a great day of it. The museum was so welcoming for our people.\u201d A group of about 10 Barkindji people visited the SAM. Security guards watched tentatively as the elders (two of whom, Aunt Priscilla and Aunt Lottie, use wheelchairs) laid their hands on the vessel. Everyone, including many museum staff, wept. \u201cWe were all just standing in the gallery crying,\u201d Carty says. \u201cI was crying. This is what our collection is about. These women had waited their whole lives to touch it and see it. And they just rang us up and said, \u2018Could we come?\u2019 We said, \u2018Of course.\u2019 And they said, \u2018We weren\u2019t expecting you to say that.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018Of course \u2013 that\u2019s what a fucking museum is for.\u2019 But I guess that\u2019s the moment we\u2019re in. Museums have to become museums for everyone rather than just for a certain niche audience in the community. And how an Australian museum becomes a place where Aboriginal people feel empowered, welcome and proud is still a work in progress.\u201d Ivy\u2019s granddaughter, Aunty Sister Girl, says: \u201cBeing there, touching that canoe, just blew my mind. I couldn\u2019t stop crying. I still can\u2019t when I think about it. John and the museum were so wonderful to us. Nobody has ever treated us that way before. With respect. Never.\u201d There have been tentative discussions about a Barkindji museum on country, a place where culture and heritage and history \u2013 describing how the ancestors worked the river on canoes \u2013 could be showcased. Carty says such discussions, should they evolve, \u201cwould be a really meaningful way to engage with them \u2013 in a long-term loan or a return, if that\u2019s what is most important\u201d. The SAM\u2019s director, Brian Oldman, together with the board and the museum\u2019s Aboriginal advisers, chose Carty from a field of international applicants because he had a clear view of where he wanted to take the museum in relation to its Indigenous collection over the next decade \u2013 and where he thought it should be in a century. \u201cHe was the clear person for this position to lead the transformation and the redefinition of Australian Aboriginal material culture at this museum, and it\u2019s manifesting itself very rapidly in that respect,\u201d Oldman says. \u201cWhen I started [in January 2014] one of the glaring observations for me was the gap between where this amazing museum should be in terms of Australian Aboriginal material culture and where it was \u2026 We can tell the material cultural story for virtually the whole of Australia but clearly we\u2019ve got some areas of depth \u2026 You say we\u2019re conservative but I\u2019d actually argue that historically the South Australian Museum has been at the forefront of Aboriginal material culture and I think we should be playing the leading role now. \u201cI would extend that into the area of custodianship and the sharing of culture \u2026 I have the view that the collections are there as part of a shared culture and that museums are much more [now] about being custodians and nurturers of culture \u2026 it can be done through exhibitions, it can be done through the travelling of objects, it can be done through the virtual access to objects and, yes, it can be done through putting an object back into a community. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t get too polarised about saying the object is owned by the museum or that the object is now going to be owned by someone else in another place. I would see it much more as a sharing of the cultural contents that that collection item gives. And there are a number of ways of sharing that cultural content and, yeah, sure, in some instances it may be that that object goes back to that community. But there are many stopping-off points between it sitting in the museum and it sitting in a community.\u201d One of the museum\u2019s imperatives is to increase the number of Indigenous staff who are curating, researching and making decisions about the collection. Last September Carty made an early statement with his appointment as curator of Aboriginal art and material culture of Glenn Iseger-Pilkington, a 35-year-old visual artist and curatorial expert from the Kimberley, of Wadjarri, Nhanda and Nyoongar \u2013 as well as Dutch and Scottish \u2013 ancestry. It seems incongruous that the museum with the biggest, most important, Indigenous collection in the world had not previously had an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person in a senior curatorial role. Late last year Rebecca Richards (a Adnyamathanha and Barngarla woman and Rhodes scholar who has researched Mountford\u2019s life and work) was selected for the museum\u2019s Pathways cadet program. Carty and Oldman aim to employ many more Indigenous people to delve in to the collections and link them back to the cultures and peoples they reflect. Carty had to find the money to hire Iseger-Pilkington. So he approached a museum volunteer, the oncologist Marg Davy \u2013 who had spent time as a doctor in Indigenous communities \u2013 to fund the position. \u201cHe approached me and talked about the importance of Aboriginal curators at a very senior level,\u201d Davy says. \u201cI wanted to make a bequest that I could see the benefit of \u2013 and I have seen those benefits, very quickly. \u201cJohn is open and engaging, very upfront and candid about what he is doing. He doesn\u2019t talk nonsense. And, I can tell you, he has had great success at convincing some of the cream of Adelaide society to part with their money to support what he is doing.\u201d The first major exhibition on Carty\u2019s watch is about the power of the yidaki (didgeridoo). The exhibition will be anchored in the life of the esteemed yidaki player Djalu Gurruwiwi, who lives at Wallaby Beach near Yirrkala in north-east Arnhem Land. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of yidakis in our collection,\u201d Carty says. \u201cAnd we could\u2019ve just mounted a display of yidakis that would\u2019ve said, \u2018Well, these are didgeridoos and this is what people used to do with them.\u201d Instead we are presenting them as a critical part of a living, ongoing culture.\u201d The exhibition will encompass film, audio and performance. We talk about the cult status of Djalu and the forthcoming exhibition as we walk through one of the dark, silent galleries featuring dozens of boomerangs. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of boomerangs,\u201d I say. He responds, \u201cYeah, I reckon we are telling the story of boomerangs but we are also telling visitors we\u2019ve got an awful lot of boomerangs. There\u2019s this idea that museums should be arbiters of fact and should just present an objective view of the world today and let the audience understand it. But museums are an expression of white culture. \u201cThey\u2019re not objective institutions and so everything that we put on display is already positioned, it\u2019s already political. It\u2019s already got power invested in it through processes of history. So we can\u2019t pretend that just putting things in a display case is a neutral thing to do. Every museum has to question the politics of display. \u201cIf we are telling the stories of boomerangs but we are not telling the stories of colonisation, frontier conflict, of native title, of stolen generations, of human rights and all these other battles that Aboriginal people have had to fight, if we are just showing boomerangs, then we are effectively abdicating our responsibility for the truth \u2026 if we are not telling those stories then we are not a museum for all Australians. We are a museum for ethnographers. We are just an average version of a British Museum.\u201d At least as far as its Indigenous collection goes, Carty is determined nobody will mistake the South Australian Museum for little Britain.",

But it\u2019s been a rough ride for the past two decades, he says, since \u201cthe government set out to slowly put us out of business\u201d. Lowe, based near Queensland\u2019s Willowbank raceway, west of Ipswich, once had five employees. Today he\u2019s a one-man show. He is \u201cscared to death\u201d a cheaper overseas competitor will start making an item of which he\u2019s currently the only manufacturer in the world. Lowe leans to the political right but feels deserted by a federal Coalition government that, in championing free trade deals, seems to be \u201cworking for somebody else but not for us\u201d. He, along with \u201cmany people I know that are in business today in Brisbane and the Gold Coast who are sick of both [major] parties\u201d, will vote for One Nation at the next state election. It\u2019s not so much a protest vote as \u201ca desperation vote\u201d, Lowe says. \u201cPeople in business, they\u2019d vote for a dead kangaroo if they thought it was going to fix some of the problems. Whether Pauline Hanson is the answer or not, she\u2019s the only one out there screaming the message everyone is listening to.\u201d Polls and pundits alike point to a Queensland election likely this year as a new high-water mark for One Nation. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be bigger than 1998,\u201d a former senior conservative politician who saw first-hand One Nation\u2019s capture of 11 seats in the state election that year, tells Guardian Australia. The party now commands the support of almost one in four Queensland voters, according to a Galaxy poll last month. And in Hanson\u2019s home state, there are signs One Nation support is spreading among business owners and white-collar professionals for whom a return to protectionist trade policy is a less pressing concern. The owner of a construction company, who asked not to be named, says Hanson\u2019s newfound appeal has dominated talk among his friends in recent months at their local pub in a leafy, wealthy enclave on the outskirts of Brisbane. All bar one of his peer group of about 20 \u201cmiddle-to-upper middle class\u201d people, which includes \u201clawyers, accountants, a mining engineer, a developer and a butcher\u201d, look poised to vote One Nation for the first time, the entrepreneur says. They\u2019re not troubled much by questions about the economy or free trade, he says: \u201cI can tell you now these people are not struggling.\u201d It\u2019s other Hanson talking points that have won them over: the folly of pursuing even the Coalition\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d renewable energy targets; the need to do away with Safe Schools; and winding back politicians\u2019 entitlements. And significantly, a longtime Hanson calling card: the need for government to ensure that migrants assimilate. To many critics, this argument is a straw man or at best a profound oversimplification; right now, Hanson is making it hit home. \u201cLet me stress, it\u2019s not like a redneck approach. It\u2019s not a group of blokes burning crosses,\u201d the entrepreneur says. \u201cIt\u2019s comments along the lines of \u2018I don\u2019t give a damn whether they\u2019re Muslim or Christian or Jewish or Hindu, what I do care is that they want to come to our country because they want to be here and assimilate into our culture\u2019. Clearly the government, state or federal, left or right, isn\u2019t putting systems in place to foster that. \u201cSo when someone like Hanson stands up and says, \u2018Ban the burqa\u2019 or \u2018Reduce immigration\u2019, they\u2019re getting the ticks.\u201d Two of the group own businesses in Clayfield, one of Brisbane\u2019s dress circle suburbs, where it\u2019s \u201cnot unheard of for either of them to have customers leaning over the counter with pro-One Nation talk\u201d, the entrepreneur says. Analyses of its resurgence in last year\u2019s federal election, which delivered the party four senators including Hanson, have found strongholds of support in rural and regional areas that show signs of economic distress compared with Australian cities. The Australian has detailed data pointing to \u201ca bleak picture of falling or stagnating wage growth, rising welfare dependence, spikes in crime and plummeting house prices\u201d. Frank Mols, a political scientist at the University of Queensland who has studied the rise and fall of populist far-right movements, says the data show ample evidence of a link between \u201chardship and populist voting\u201d. But Mols argues One Nation\u2019s revival should not be seen primarily as a \u201cworking-class revolt\u201d, which in comparable cases such as Donald Trump\u2019s US election victory and Brexit had been shown to be \u201ca myth\u201d. Instead, Mols predicts One Nation\u2019s surge in popularity will be mostly about a party finding fertile ground among relatively affluent voters. These are voters with above-average incomes who can afford homes in nice suburbs, overseas holidays and even private-school education. They are anxious to protect their relative affluence and upward mobility, and can easily become wary of immigrants and minorities \u201cespecially if politicians tell them they ought to be fearful of these groups\u201d, he says. Mols says the relatively affluent have proven time and again to be as susceptible as the economically disadvantaged to politicians\u2019 anti-immigrant messages. It is average earners between these groups who are \u201cnot particularly worried about where they stand in the social ladder who are least susceptible\u201d, Mols says. He and UQ social psychologist Jolanda Jetten have run \u201cseveral experiments to verify this, and our findings confirmed this pattern very clearly\u201d, which they will document in their upcoming book, The Wealth Paradox: Economic Prosperity and the Hardening of Attitudes. \u201cWhat you see is populists like Pauline Hanson pointing the finger to what they describe as \u2018the leftist urban elite\u2019, and telling middle-class voters that their taxes are being used to subsidise these latte-sipping city dwellers,\u201d Mols says. \u201cThis is a very effective strategy, which has less to do with fear for immigrants or asylum seekers and more to do with envy. So, effectively, they tell lower middle-class voters, \u2018They have the lifestyle and you are doing the hard work.\u2019\u201d Mols says surges in populist voting don\u2019t require economic downturns to thrive. In fact, they may even spring from economic upswings when the middle class feel pressure to make the most of improving fortunes. Mols says there is good evidence populism thrives on \u201cenvy and a sense that others are about to seize what we are entitled to\u201d. A One Nation source tells Guardian Australia that whenever the party raises the topic of Muslim immigration on social media, engagement is \u201coff the scale\u201d. The source, who asked not to be named, says he is unaware of party research on supporter demographics. But anecdotal observations by Hanson and her Senate colleagues \u201con the ground\u201d tell them the \u201cmix of support is extraordinarily complex\u201d. Mols says he has shared with major party representatives his observations that stereotypes about One Nation voters \u2013 older, less educated men in low-income areas \u2013 are misleading. One major party campaigner exhaled an expletive and volunteered \u201cwe may have gotten this really wrong\u201d when considering the implications for the election, he says. An MP from an affluent suburban Brisbane seat also \u201cappeared in shock\u201d when they had a similar conversation. One donor to the Liberal National party tells Guardian Australia he is aware of several prominent, wealthy Brisbane business figures who will desert the party to vote One Nation. An executive from a major stockmarket-listed company will do so, in spite of a personal distaste for Hanson, to protest the LNP abandoning \u201cconservative ideals\u201d, he says. Other One Nation converts include a tech entrepreneur who has surrendered a long identification with the National party, the LNP donor says. There are other snapshots of what Mols calls the \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d basis of One Nation\u2019s appeal. A solicitor who runs an inner Brisbane law firm tells Guardian Australia he will consider voting One Nation in part because of Hanson\u2019s communication style. \u201cShe\u2019ll just give it to you straight. I think people appreciate that,\u201d he says.

That\u2019s the type of immigrants we should still be trying to get.\u201d Paul Williams, a political scientist at Griffith University, says Mols\u2019s predictions about One Nation drawing most of its support from the middle class are likely to be borne out. \u201cMy argument has been for some time now that since Hanson resurfaced in July, that One Nation is morphing from a working-class party to one that is leeching into the middle class,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to people on six-figure incomes, public servants, tertiary educated \u2013 obviously not representative and still a small number \u2013 but they will be voting One Nation. \u201cThat\u2019s proof enough that Hanson\u2019s rhetoric is cutting across the class barrier.\u201d Williams says there are two factors that will prompt people \u201cwith good jobs and kids in private schools\u201d to vote for Hanson for the first time. \u201cAn anti-Islam sentiment and \u2013 this keeps coming up time and again - there\u2019s a big section of the electorate that keeps talking about political correctness gone mad,\u201d he says. \u201cHanson\u2019s strength lies in pushing this rather than the economic issues because she knows it\u2019s a generic button: push it and it will resonate in the fringes of Brisbane, in Cairns, in northern New South Wales, you name it.

      "bodyText": "As the evening light settles over a Rapid Creek backyard, eight Tiwi Island sistagirls are making their final preparations to fly to Sydney. A large portion of the 30 Aboriginal transgender women from the islands, north of Darwin, are already in Sydney, sending daily selfies and Facebook updates as they explore the southern city. For many, it\u2019s their first time in Sydney. It will be everyone\u2019s first ever Mardi Gras. This year\u2019s event is the 39th Sydney Mardi Gras, born from protests about LGBTQI rights in the 1970s. More than 10,000 people are expected to march in the parade, which has grown into an international event, drawing crowds of hundreds of thousands to Sydney\u2019s Oxford street. There\u2019s a discussion around the Rapid Creek table about just how famous the sistagirls are already. Over the years, there have been regular news stories about them, and in recent weeks just about every outlet has covered their Mardi Gras plans. But all that is pretty abstract until they take centre stage at what is arguably Australia\u2019s biggest party. The Tiwi Islands is home to just a few thousand people. By contrast, about 300,000 people are expected to attend the parade, which is also broadcast nationally and reported worldwide. Patricia Puruntatameri\u2019s hand goes to her heart and she tears up a little. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to think. Wow. It\u2019s going to be so exciting, I can just imagine it already. Oh em gee!\u201d She laughs. The sistagirls are a close-knit group from across the Tiwi communities, who have supported each other through decades of seeking acceptance. Years past have been marred by suicides, bullying and discrimination. Jayma Timaepatua says they\u2019ll be marching \u201cto remember the older sistagirls, who have passed away and who have pain\u201d. \u201cIf not for them I wouldn\u2019t be here for now,\u201d she says. The group first began planning the Mardi Gras adventure late last year. Various subsets within the 30 have travelled with the assistance of crowdfunding, support from the local art centre, or with money from their own pocket. Staying in Redfern, they\u2019ll have spent Friday getting their nails, hair and makeup done. Their costumes are in traditional Tiwi designs featuring clan totem animals, hand-printed in glowing rainbow paint. \u201cWe\u2019re all excited about going. We just finished screen printing, and the colour has come out so nice,\u201d says Lima Alimankinni. The Northern Territory float, expected to be towards the front of the parade will feature twinkling stars, representing the Northern Territory skies. No one really knows what to expect, but they hope to meet sistagirls from other communities as well as a few celebrities including NT locals Miranda Tapsell and Rob Collins. Alex Greenwich, the independent Sydney MP and co-chair of the Australian Marriage Equality Campaign, says the sistagirls coming to Sydney is a reminder of the breadth of Australia\u2019s LGBTI community. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for Australia\u2019s LGBTI community to really be welcoming, inclusive and celebrate entrants like that and to also make sure there are those connections made,\u201d he told Guardian Australia this week. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure there is also lots of stuff we can learn from the strong sense of community I know the sistagirls on the Tiwi Islands have.\u201d \u201cTo go to the Mardi Gras is to showcase our culture and our people, how Tiwi people evolved in this generation and how we became stronger in our community,\u201d sistagirl Crystal Johnson told the ABC. \u201cTo show people you can make a change.\u201d Puruntatameri says she might also like to tell others in the LGBTI community about life on the Tiwi Islands, \u201cto tell them about our hunting and gathering, and singing\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to walk and wave to the people,\u201d she says. \u201cTo say that we\u2019re here,\u201d interjects Anthony Tipungwuti.

      "bodyText": "A federal court judge has drawn a line under the high-profile racial discrimination claim against three Queensland University of Technology students, saying they and their accuser had \u201csuffered\u201d from prolonged legal proceedings. On Friday, Justice John Dowsett quashed an attempt by former QUT staff member Cindy Prior to revive her claim against the three students over Facebook comments criticising an Indigenous-only computer room where she worked. Prior\u2019s lawsuit against QUT and students Callum Thwaites, Jackson Powell and Alex Wood, which sought $250,000 damages for alleged breaches of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, was dismissed by the federal circuit court in November. Dowsett denied Prior leave to appeal that ruling, and an extension of time to lodge it, saying: \u201cI\u2019m very serious about this \u2013 this matter must be brought to an end.\u201d He said: \u201cThese four young people have suffered more from legal proceedings than almost any other young person will in a lifetime.\u201d Dowsett called on lawyers for all four to use their \u201cskills, knowledge and experience to bring these proceedings to an end\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a great pity it hasn\u2019t been brought to an end before now,\u201d he said. The judge ordered Prior to pay for the students\u2019 legal costs of just under $15,000 from the latest court case. Prior faces possible bankruptcy from having to pay legal costs from the earlier federal circuit court case. That figure is yet to be calculated but Tony Morris, the barrister for Powell and Thwaites, said it could run well into \u201csix figures\u201d. Morris said outside court that the judge\u2019s decision showed \u201cnone of the arguments\u201d raised by Prior had a prospect of succeeding on appeal. The trigger for the complaint was a comment by Wood on a QUT students Facebook page in 2013 suggesting Prior, then employed in the Indigenous studies unit, had asked him and other white students to leave the computer room. Wood commented that QUT was \u201cstopping segregation with segregation\u201d. Powell asked where the \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d computer lab was. Thwaites was accused of posting \u201cITT niggers\u201d but he has denied being responsible for the account and the federal court judge Michael Jarrett found there was no evidence otherwise. Jarrett found Wood\u2019s comment was \u201crallying against racial discrimination\u201d and directed at QUT, while Powell\u2019s was a \u201cpoor attempt at humour\u201d unlikely to offend or insult Indigenous people. In court papers filed in December, Prior\u2019s barrister, Greg McIntyre, argued that the court had erred in part by failing to consider the effect on Indigenous QUT students of claims they had \u201cno entitlement\u201d to the room, a \u201cspecial measure\u201d allowed under Australian and international discrimination law. The QUT case became a lightning rod for critics of 18C and the Australian Human Rights Commission, which was charged with handling the original complaint. Critics say the fact that students posting on Facebook were drawn into a three-year saga culminating in expensive legal action and publicity shows the need to reform 18C and raise the hurdles for racial discrimination complaints. Prior has also been subject to a flood of online threats and abuse after publicity about her case, prompting her to complain to the Australian federal police. Her solicitor, Susan Moriarty, also said last year she had referred a violent threat to the police, which had prompted her to take stress leave.",

      "bodyText": "The Manus Island immigration centre\u2019s medical facility appears to have operated without medical registration for at least 10 months. The clinic\u2019s operator, International Health and Medical Services (IHMS), said in a statement it was registered to provide medical services in Papua New Guinea and became aware of issues over its clinic\u2019s licence in May last year. A Papua New Guinea news outlet, the National, went further, reporting that a PNG independent review committee report had revealed the medical centre had not been properly registered for three years from 2013, after being given temporary approval to operate a day clinic out of makeshift containers. The committee reportedly accused IHMS of breaching the registration act and the health minister was preparing a report for parliament, according to the ABC. IHMS has confirmed to Guardian Australia it was told the PNG Medical Board had concerns over its registration in May but the PNG government has not responded to its requests for clarification over conflicting information. However, in May it was made aware that the PNG medical board \u201chad concerns regarding the licensing of the medical clinic on Manus Island\u201d. \u201cSince being made aware of the issue, IHMS has submitted all required documentation to the PNG medical board to enable the licensing of the Manus clinic, and has sought guidance from the PNG medical board on who should hold the licence. IHMS has received conflicting advice from the PNG government regarding who should hold the licence.\u201d The spokesman said all staff \u2013 including 54 Papua New Guineans, 37 Australians, and 12 other nationals \u2013 were registered in accordance with PNG laws and regulations. IHMS has been subject to intense scrutiny and criticism over its handling of healthcare for asylum seekers and refugees at the Manus Island centre, following several deaths. At a coronial inquest in Brisbane last month, IHMS and the Australian department of immigration appeared to blame each other for the failures in healthcare, which led to the death of Hamid Kehazaei. The National reported that PNG health minister Michael Malabag had written to prime minister Peter O\u2019Neil in January to raise other alleged breaches, including against taxation, labour and migration laws, and now said they should be looked at with the alleged medical registration issue. He suggested Isos, the parent company of IHMS, be allowed to withdraw its services, accusing them of breaching the Medical Registration Act, something he said would be \u201ca serious criminal offence\u201d. IHMS denied the allegations of further breaches, and said they were among \u201cmultiple unfounded accusations\u201d directed at the company \u201cas a result of competing commercial interests within the healthcare sector in PNG\u201d. \u201cIn October 2016, IHMS provided the PNG government all the information required to refute these allegations. IHMS was informed by the PNG chief secretary that a report on its investigation would be issued to us within a week and we could then work collaboratively with the PNG government to resolve any outstanding issues. \u201cThis report has never been issued and our multiple requests to meet with the PNG chief secretary, the PNG minister for health, and other government officials have been ignored.\u201d"

The gathering of 3,000 delegates for the national people\u2019s congress in Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People is staged annually by the party. And although it has little bearing on policy, it will be scrutinised this year for any clues about the state of the economy in premier Li Keqiang\u2019s annual report on Sunday. This will include a target for economic growth, which analysts expect to be unchanged from last year at between 6.5-7%. Growth in that band would continue the slowest rates for more than a quarter of a century, a development which has complicated government efforts to shift from an economic model based on debt-fuelled investment and exports towards a consumer-driven one. The government also wants to trim its bloated state-owned government industries while tackling a slumping currency, massive capital flight by Chinese enterprises seeking better returns abroad, and fears of a housing bubble and bad-loan crisis. The total of Chinese debt has reached almost 250% of GDP and Capital Economics China expert Julian Evans-Pritchard warned this week that the window for Beijing to tackle the problem by recapitalising the banks and allowing state firms to fail was \u201cclosing fast\u201d. The currency issue could also become a flashpoint. The yuan fell on Friday below the 6.9 per dollar level for the first time in one-and-a-half months, as the greenback continued to gain momentum on expectations of higher US interest rates. Pressure on the Chinese currency was due to growing expectations the Federal Reserve could raise rates as early as this month after a solid run of US economic data and policymakers hinting a rate rise would be appropriate soon. Traders will be looking for signs about whether the Beijing government is prepared to let the yuan fall further against the dollar and risk the wrath of US president Donald Trump, who has accused China of keeping the yuan low in order to boost exports to the detriment of US producers. However, the People\u2019s Bank of China has burned through a trillion dollars of foreign exchange reserves since 2014 in order to keep the yuan from falling even further, according to Capital Economics, and traders believe Beijing could allow the currency to float more freely against the dollar. But caution and control are expected to dominate NPC discussions. \u201cWe expect the meeting this year to confirm a shift in policy towards reining in risks and away from supporting short-run growth,\u201d Capital Economics said in a report. In perhaps a preview of NPC discourse, China\u2019s new banking watchdog Guo Shuqing warned Thursday of threats posed by debt-strapped state-owned firms, inflated real-estate markets, and massive unregulated lending.

He is expected to unveil a leadership shuffle at the autumn gathering amid speculation it could indicate he intends to stay on beyond the traditional 10-year term. \u201cThis is a watershed year,\u201d China politics analyst Willy Lam, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said of the political machinations. Anticipated to run for 10 days amid heavy security, the NPC kicks off with a splash of colour as delegates from China\u2019s dozens of ethnic minorities arrive in traditional dress alongside military officers in full uniform \u2013 meant to reinforce national unity.

Official forecasts nonetheless say the capital will be shrouded in smog this weekend.",

Some tedious bores even insist that if there are no bitters in a mixed drink, it has no business calling itself a cocktail.

Just over a decade ago, that was an easy question to answer \u2013 it was hard work to find any bitters other than Angostura, the brand of aromatic bitters with the familiar <a href=\"http://www.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/xxl/80279/362008.jpg\">oversize label</a> seen in bars around the world. Now there\u2019s a dizzying panoply of bitters brands and flavours available, from unorthodox flavour combinations (<a href=\"http://fivebyfivetonics.com/product/grapefruit-oolong-bitters/\">grapefruit oolong</a> or <a href=\"http://www.onlybitters.com/dashfire-bitters-co-mr-lees-ancient-chinese-secret-50ml/\">ginger and Sichuan pepper</a>) to contemporary classics (<a href=\"http://bittermens.com/products/xocolatl-mole-bitters/\">xocolatl mole</a> and <a href=\"http://scrappysbitters.com/product/lavender/\">lavender</a>) to old brands resurrected (<a href=\"http://and1morefortheroad.blogspot.com.au/2013/05/the-abbotts-bitters-debate.html\">Abbott\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"http://www.doctoradams.co.uk/bokers-bitters.html\">Boker\u2019s</a>). It\u2019s easy to see how some home bartenders can really catch the bitters-collecting bug and garner hundreds of tiny bottles. </p> <p>Realistically, you need only three different types of bitters to make the vast majority of cocktails: an aromatic bitters (the aforementioned Angostura, or one of their competitors such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://the-bitter-truth.com/bitter/old-time-aromatic-bitters/\">The Bitter Truth\u2019s Old Time Aromatic Bitters</a> or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.doctoradams.co.uk/orinoco-aromatic-bitters.html\">Adam Elmegirab\u2019s Orinoco Bitters</a>), an orange bitters (such as the one made by Angostura, or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.gazregan.com/regans-orange-bitters-no-6/\">Gary Regan\u2019s Orange Bitters no. 6</a>), and a Creole bitters (a sub-genre of aromatic bitters formerly restricted to one brand, Peychaud\u2019s, competing versions of which are now made by a number of smaller producers). Once you have these three types of bitters, you can make a huge number of different classic cocktails at home: old-fashioneds, martinis, Manhattans, sazeracs \u2026</p> <p>Most cocktails only call for tiny dashes of bitters, but a few recipes call for serious quantities of them. The most successful of these recipes is New York-based bartender Giuseppe Gonzalez\u2019s Trinidad sour, which uses Angostura bitters not as a modifier but as the drink\u2019s base spirit. It\u2019s a crazy idea for a drink, but one that counterintuitively works.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"468e25f1e48feb60410c601ee10a6734f16a47d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/468e25f1e48feb60410c601ee10a6734f16a47d3/0_0_6042_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bitters, spices and infusions on bar counter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">These days, there is a dizzying panoply of bitters brands and flavours available.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kondor83/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Make it at home: Trinidad sour</strong></p> <p>30 ml Angostura bitters<br />30 ml orgeat<br />22.5 ml lemon juice<br />15 ml high-proof rye whiskey</p> <p>To measure the Angostura, pop the plastic dasher top off your bottle with a butter knife and pour the bitters into a jigger as you would any other spirit.

Vermouth</h2> <p>A few years ago, the elderflower liqueur St-Germain was pejoratively called \u201cbartender\u2019s ketchup\u201d \u2013 because bartenders had a bad habit of putting some of it in every new drink they concocted. But the recent mania for St-Germain had nothing on the late 19th century craze for vermouth, which took American bartenders and their clients by storm. By the turn of the century, bartenders were throwing splashes of vermouth into just about everything \u2013 and in so doing created the Manhattan and the martini.</p> <p>Alas, vermouth\u2019s reign behind the bar was ended by the one-two punch of prohibition and the second world war (which entangled both Italy and France, vermouth\u2019s home territories) \u2013 and aside from the aforementioned Manhattans and martinis, vermouth-based drinks were very much out of favour throughout the late twentieth century. Thanks to the resurgence of interest in classic cocktails and pre-prohibition drinking culture, though, you can now find high-quality vermouth nearly anywhere you\u2019d care to look.</p> <p>For the home bar, you\u2019ll really only need two different types of vermouth \u2013 a sweet red one (also known as an Italian or <em>rosso</em> vermouth) and a dry white one (also known as a French vermouth). If you acquire a taste for the stuff, you might want to supplement these two bottles with a sweet white one (also known as a <em>blanc</em> or <em>bianco</em> vermouth). Thus armed, you\u2019ll be ready to enjoy any number of classic cocktails \u2013 not just the Manhattan and martini, but also the Negroni, the martinez, the turf club, the Rob Roy, the boulevardier, the old pal \u2026 and this, the Adonis, an elegantly simple and delicious low-ABV aperitif cocktail.</p> <p><strong>Make it at home: Adonis</strong></p> <p>45 ml dry, oxidatively aged sherry (Amontillado, Palo Cortado, or Oloroso)<br />45 ml sweet vermouth<br />Two dashes orange bitters</p> <p>Build all ingredients in a mixing glass.

Strain into a chilled cocktail coupe and garnish with a twist of orange peel.</p> <p><strong>Pair with a song: </strong>The Magnetic Fields\u2019 I Don\u2019t Want To Get Over You suggests that drinking vermouth \u2013 alongside dressing in black, reading Camus, and smoking clove cigarettes \u2013 might be a good way to get over a breakup. Your mileage may vary.</p> <h2>3. Absinthe</h2> <p>No other category of spirit has suffered as much as absinthe has over the years. After rapidly gaining popularity in late 19th century France \u2013 as a replacement for wine and brandy made scarce by the scourge of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylloxera\">phylloxera</a> \u2013 it was the subject of a full-blown moral panic fomented by both vintners (who resented its newfound popularity) and the temperance movement. The 1905 Lanfray affair \u2013 in which French labourer Jean Lanfray killed his pregnant wife and two children while under the influence of absinthe \u2013 provided the pretext for strict government controls over absinthe, and a global wave of absinthe bans followed.</p> <p>The fact that absinthe was illegal in many parts of the world throughout most of the 20th century gave it an illicit countercultural cred \u2013 those alive in 2001 might remember the micro-scandal when Kylie Minogue <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg7QyVDfMiE\">made a cameo as <em>la f\u00e9e verte</em>, the personification of absinthe</a>, in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Moulin Rouge. That (now quite daggy) cred didn\u2019t help much though, as countries around the world overturned their absinthe bans in the face of new evidence that absinthe was only as harmful as any other high-ABV spirit. Cheap and nasty Czech-style \u201cabsinthes\u201d flooded the market, leaving most consumers with the impression that absinthe is a gimmicky drink \u2013 something to be consumed as a shot, or set on fire. </p> <p>Taste a proper Swiss or French-style absinthe, though, and you\u2019ll find a drink that\u2019s complex, herbaceous, and surprisingly mellow for something with such high ABV. You\u2019ll also see why American bartenders of the 1860s and 70s, having heard rumbles about the drink\u2019s popularity on the continent, began putting a little dash of \u201cthe green stuff\u201d into just about everything they mixed, where its strong anise and bitter wormwood notes would perform the same role as aromatic bitters. </p> <p>As such, a little Japanese-style dasher bottle filled with absinthe is one of those tools that you might initially think is a little superfluous, but that you will shortly come to regard as indispensable for your home bar. And one of the best cocktails to showcase absinthe\u2019s indispensability is the corpse reviver no. 2, a delightfully sharp concoction designed to cure hangovers. Just remember that, in the words of The Savoy Cocktail Book, \u201cFour of these taken in swift succession will unrevive the corpse again.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Make it at home: corpse reviver no. 2</strong></p> <p>22.5 ml gin<br />22.5 ml Cocchi Americano, Lillet Blanc, or other white quinquina<br />22.5 ml orange liqueur (Cointreau, Pierre Ferrand dry cura\u00e7ao, or similar)<br />22.5 ml lemon juice<br />Two small dashes absinthe</p> <p>Build all ingredients in a shaker. Add ice and shake to chill. Double strain into a chilled cocktail coupe and garnish with a twist of lemon peel.</p> <p><strong>Pair with a story: </strong>Poppy Z Brite\u2019s His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood \u2013 the constant references to absinthe in Brite\u2019s transgressive and sexually explicit horror writing gave the spirit much of its countercultural cachet in the 1990s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc2cab2b28c1e3182101016376ab497012d0163d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc2cab2b28c1e3182101016376ab497012d0163d/0_223_4191_2514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Box of harvested red ripe cherry fruit variety RiversCountry Diary 29 July 2015 by Virginia Spiers: harvested red ripe cherry fruit variety Rivers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maraschino is made from marasca cherries, which come from the Dalmatia region of what is now Croatia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Cattlin/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. Maraschino</h2> <p>While absinthe is one of the most misunderstood and long-suffering spirits categories, at least it has brand recognition. The same can\u2019t really be said for maraschino, a clear cherry-based \u2013 but not really cherry-flavoured \u2013 liqueur from Dalmatia that\u2019s practically unknown outside of bartending circles. It\u2019s common to see a little caveat applied to recipes that call for maraschino to remind readers that maraschino liqueur is not the same thing as the syrup that maraschino cherries come in. It\u2019s even more often mispronounced than not \u2013 the \u201csch\u201d is a hard \u201csk\u201d sound, so it\u2019s mara-skee-no, not mara-sheen-o.</p> <p>Maraschino is made from marasca cherries, which themselves come from the Dalmatia region of what is now Croatia \u2013 and both the cherries and the Dalmatia region have caused a few complications for the liqueur and its originators, the Italian Luxardo family. Maraschino cherries used to be marasca cherries brined in ocean water and preserved in maraschino liqueur, but they\u2019re now, for the most part, neon-red, syrupy-sweet franken-fruit that have been leached of their natural colour and flavour by calcium-laden brines. (A few brands, most notably Luxardo, make non-alcoholic versions of maraschino cherries that cleave closely to the original template.) The second world war also threw a spanner in the works, as the allies bombed the original Luxardo maraschino factory in Italian-held Zara (now Zadar, Croatia), then Tito\u2019s partisans swept in to secure the city for Yugoslavia. All of which meant that, until relatively recently, it was often quite difficult to acquire maraschino liqueur. There are a few competing brands of note \u2013 including the Croatian Maraska, still made in Zadar \u2013 but I\u2019m a firm believer that the original, in this case, is still the best.</p> <p>As the liqueur has such a powerful and funky flavour, it tends to overwhelm drinks if poured liberally \u2013 I tend to avoid putting more than a quarter-ounce (7.5 ml) in any given drink, unless there\u2019s a very good reason to do so. But once you master the precision required to wield this ingredient well, you\u2019ll soon discover that it has many uses in the bar \u2013 not least of which is adding the signature <em>je ne sais quoi </em>to the classic Hemingway daiquiri. </p> <p><strong>Make it at home: Hemingway daiquiri</strong></p> <p>This recipe is in fact not what Hemingway himself drank. His preferred recipe was really Constantino Ribalaigua Vert\u2019s Daiquiri no. 4, just with double the rum and no sugar \u2013 an unbalanced mess. (Whatever you think about his prose, Hemingway made a better writer than he did a mixologist.) The following is my own recipe that takes inspiration from Ribalaigua Vert\u2019s Daiquiris no. 3 and no. 4, but rebalances the drink so it can be served up in a coupe instead of over crushed ice. If you want a stiffer drink, feel free to bump the rum up to 60 ml.</p> <p>45 ml white rum<br />15 ml lime juice<br />15 ml pink grapefruit juice (unsweetened)<br />7.5 ml maraschino liqueur (preferably Luxardo)<br />5 ml (one bar spoon) simple syrup</p> <p>Build all ingredients in a shaker. Add ice and shake to chill. Double strain into a chilled cocktail coupe and either garnish with an authentic maraschino cherry, or leave as unadorned as Hemingway\u2019s prose style.</p> <p><strong>Pair with a book:</strong> Philip Greene\u2019s book To Have and Have Another goes into a ludicrous amount of detail about Hemingway\u2019s drinking habits and the drinks that appeared in his writing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0c301f49bebdee9fc34aac41a7d7d9c23fc17f39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c301f49bebdee9fc34aac41a7d7d9c23fc17f39/0_0_5035_3335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White Lady CocktailDBFCC4 White Lady Cocktail\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The white lady cocktail</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5. Orange liqueur</h2> <p>Of all of the useful modifiers to have in your cocktail cabinet at home, this is the one most likely to be there already \u2013 after all, lots of us love a cheeky dram of Cointreau, or keep some Grand Marnier around for cooking. This is great news for the beginner cocktail maker \u2013 orange liqueurs of one sort or another turn up in all sorts of classic cocktails, from the indefatigable margarita through to the stately sidecar and the exotic Pegu Club.</p> <p>There\u2019s a fair bit of terminological confusion about the category \u2013 those who truly wish to geek out about the differences between cura\u00e7aos and triple secs can consult the section devoted to the subject in Andrew Willett\u2019s book Elemental Mixology \u2013 but the take-home is simple: like nearly any kind of spirit, you get what you pay for. Cheap triple secs are one-dimensional and taste like orange Lifesavers; more expensive options, like the aforementioned Cointreau and Grand Marnier or Pierre Ferrand\u2019s excellent dry cura\u00e7ao, taste vibrantly of real oranges, zest and all. Which one you choose for your home liquor cabinet is a matter of personal taste; the only caveat is that Grand Marnier is a little sweeter and more unctuous than its competitors, which means you might want to pour it with a lighter hand.</p> <p>The white lady is one of those cocktails that are infrequently found on cocktail menus in the wild \u2013 probably because it\u2019s one of those drinks that are rarely ordered by customers, and one that bartenders generally think of as a bit of old hat. It is, however, a model of elegance and simplicity, and a cocktail that can be made with commonly found ingredients.</p> <p>One quick note \u2013 depending on the acidity of your lemons and the sweetness of your orange liqueur, you might need to bump up the sweetness of the drink by adding a touch of simple syrup, which you can make by mixing equal parts (by volume) of caster sugar and hot water and stirring until the sugar dissolves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/30/five-thoroughly-impressive-cocktails-you-can-easily-make-at-home\">Five thoroughly impressive cocktails you can easily make at home</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Make it at home: white lady</strong><br /></p> <p>45 ml gin<br />22.5 ml orange liqueur<br />22.5 ml lemon juice<br />One egg white</p> <p>Build all ingredients in a shaker.

Your heart sinks \u2013 the answer is, well, \u201cNot much.\u201d Professional cocktail bartenders don\u2019t just work with the well-known \u201cbase spirits\u201d that you can find in any liquor store. They also work with a host of more recondite ingredients known in industry lingo as \u201cmodifiers\u201d, which enable the alchemical transformation of the base metals of those popular spirits into the gold of a balanced cocktail. Some of these ingredients are poured liberally, while others are applied only in judicious little splashes and dashes \u2013 but asking someone to make a cocktail without them is like asking a chef to turn a raw steak into a meal with only a frypan. If you\u2019d like to enjoy more cocktails at home, consider stocking a few of these indispensables. 1. Bitters There\u2019s an old saying about bitters: that they are to cocktails as salt and pepper are to cooking. In fact, the first known print definition of the term \u201ccocktail\u201d, from 1806 (\u201ca stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters \u2013 it is vulgarly called bittered sling\u201d) has made bitters the sine qua non of the cocktail. Some tedious bores even insist that if there are no bitters in a mixed drink, it has no business calling itself a cocktail. While I personally wouldn\u2019t go that far, I think it\u2019s fair to say that bitters are the first ingredient you should buy if you want to make cocktails at home. But which bitters should you buy? Just over a decade ago, that was an easy question to answer \u2013 it was hard work to find any bitters other than Angostura, the brand of aromatic bitters with the familiar oversize label seen in bars around the world. Now there\u2019s a dizzying panoply of bitters brands and flavours available, from unorthodox flavour combinations (grapefruit oolong or ginger and Sichuan pepper) to contemporary classics (xocolatl mole and lavender) to old brands resurrected (Abbott\u2019s and Boker\u2019s). It\u2019s easy to see how some home bartenders can really catch the bitters-collecting bug and garner hundreds of tiny bottles. Realistically, you need only three different types of bitters to make the vast majority of cocktails: an aromatic bitters (the aforementioned Angostura, or one of their competitors such as The Bitter Truth\u2019s Old Time Aromatic Bitters or Adam Elmegirab\u2019s Orinoco Bitters), an orange bitters (such as the one made by Angostura, or Gary Regan\u2019s Orange Bitters no. 6), and a Creole bitters (a sub-genre of aromatic bitters formerly restricted to one brand, Peychaud\u2019s, competing versions of which are now made by a number of smaller producers). Once you have these three types of bitters, you can make a huge number of different classic cocktails at home: old-fashioneds, martinis, Manhattans, sazeracs \u2026 Most cocktails only call for tiny dashes of bitters, but a few recipes call for serious quantities of them. The most successful of these recipes is New York-based bartender Giuseppe Gonzalez\u2019s Trinidad sour, which uses Angostura bitters not as a modifier but as the drink\u2019s base spirit. It\u2019s a crazy idea for a drink, but one that counterintuitively works. Make it at home: Trinidad sour 30 ml Angostura bitters 30 ml orgeat 22.5 ml lemon juice 15 ml high-proof rye whiskey To measure the Angostura, pop the plastic dasher top off your bottle with a butter knife and pour the bitters into a jigger as you would any other spirit. Build all ingredients in a shaker. Add ice and shake to chill. Double strain into a chilled cocktail coupe and serve without a garnish. Take care while making and drinking this cocktail \u2013 both the bitters and the cocktail itself will permanently stain just about anything they come into contact with. Pair with a film: Vincent Sherman\u2019s 1952 film Affair in Trinidad is a cheesy little slice of noir, most notable for being Rita Hayworth\u2019s comeback film after a four-year hiatus from acting. 2. Vermouth A few years ago, the elderflower liqueur St-Germain was pejoratively called \u201cbartender\u2019s ketchup\u201d \u2013 because bartenders had a bad habit of putting some of it in every new drink they concocted. But the recent mania for St-Germain had nothing on the late 19th century craze for vermouth, which took American bartenders and their clients by storm. By the turn of the century, bartenders were throwing splashes of vermouth into just about everything \u2013 and in so doing created the Manhattan and the martini. Alas, vermouth\u2019s reign behind the bar was ended by the one-two punch of prohibition and the second world war (which entangled both Italy and France, vermouth\u2019s home territories) \u2013 and aside from the aforementioned Manhattans and martinis, vermouth-based drinks were very much out of favour throughout the late twentieth century. Thanks to the resurgence of interest in classic cocktails and pre-prohibition drinking culture, though, you can now find high-quality vermouth nearly anywhere you\u2019d care to look. For the home bar, you\u2019ll really only need two different types of vermouth \u2013 a sweet red one (also known as an Italian or rosso vermouth) and a dry white one (also known as a French vermouth). If you acquire a taste for the stuff, you might want to supplement these two bottles with a sweet white one (also known as a blanc or bianco vermouth). Thus armed, you\u2019ll be ready to enjoy any number of classic cocktails \u2013 not just the Manhattan and martini, but also the Negroni, the martinez, the turf club, the Rob Roy, the boulevardier, the old pal \u2026 and this, the Adonis, an elegantly simple and delicious low-ABV aperitif cocktail. Make it at home: Adonis 45 ml dry, oxidatively aged sherry (Amontillado, Palo Cortado, or Oloroso) 45 ml sweet vermouth Two dashes orange bitters Build all ingredients in a mixing glass. Add ice and stir to chill. Strain into a chilled cocktail coupe and garnish with a twist of orange peel. Pair with a song: The Magnetic Fields\u2019 I Don\u2019t Want To Get Over You suggests that drinking vermouth \u2013 alongside dressing in black, reading Camus, and smoking clove cigarettes \u2013 might be a good way to get over a breakup. Your mileage may vary. 3. Absinthe No other category of spirit has suffered as much as absinthe has over the years. After rapidly gaining popularity in late 19th century France \u2013 as a replacement for wine and brandy made scarce by the scourge of phylloxera \u2013 it was the subject of a full-blown moral panic fomented by both vintners (who resented its newfound popularity) and the temperance movement. The 1905 Lanfray affair \u2013 in which French labourer Jean Lanfray killed his pregnant wife and two children while under the influence of absinthe \u2013 provided the pretext for strict government controls over absinthe, and a global wave of absinthe bans followed. The fact that absinthe was illegal in many parts of the world throughout most of the 20th century gave it an illicit countercultural cred \u2013 those alive in 2001 might remember the micro-scandal when Kylie Minogue made a cameo as la f\u00e9e verte, the personification of absinthe, in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Moulin Rouge. That (now quite daggy) cred didn\u2019t help much though, as countries around the world overturned their absinthe bans in the face of new evidence that absinthe was only as harmful as any other high-ABV spirit. Cheap and nasty Czech-style \u201cabsinthes\u201d flooded the market, leaving most consumers with the impression that absinthe is a gimmicky drink \u2013 something to be consumed as a shot, or set on fire. Taste a proper Swiss or French-style absinthe, though, and you\u2019ll find a drink that\u2019s complex, herbaceous, and surprisingly mellow for something with such high ABV. You\u2019ll also see why American bartenders of the 1860s and 70s, having heard rumbles about the drink\u2019s popularity on the continent, began putting a little dash of \u201cthe green stuff\u201d into just about everything they mixed, where its strong anise and bitter wormwood notes would perform the same role as aromatic bitters. As such, a little Japanese-style dasher bottle filled with absinthe is one of those tools that you might initially think is a little superfluous, but that you will shortly come to regard as indispensable for your home bar. And one of the best cocktails to showcase absinthe\u2019s indispensability is the corpse reviver no. 2, a delightfully sharp concoction designed to cure hangovers. Just remember that, in the words of The Savoy Cocktail Book, \u201cFour of these taken in swift succession will unrevive the corpse again.\u201d Make it at home: corpse reviver no. 2 22.5 ml gin 22.5 ml Cocchi Americano, Lillet Blanc, or other white quinquina 22.5 ml orange liqueur (Cointreau, Pierre Ferrand dry cura\u00e7ao, or similar) 22.5 ml lemon juice Two small dashes absinthe Build all ingredients in a shaker. Add ice and shake to chill. Double strain into a chilled cocktail coupe and garnish with a twist of lemon peel. Pair with a story: Poppy Z Brite\u2019s His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood \u2013 the constant references to absinthe in Brite\u2019s transgressive and sexually explicit horror writing gave the spirit much of its countercultural cachet in the 1990s. 4. Maraschino While absinthe is one of the most misunderstood and long-suffering spirits categories, at least it has brand recognition. The same can\u2019t really be said for maraschino, a clear cherry-based \u2013 but not really cherry-flavoured \u2013 liqueur from Dalmatia that\u2019s practically unknown outside of bartending circles. It\u2019s common to see a little caveat applied to recipes that call for maraschino to remind readers that maraschino liqueur is not the same thing as the syrup that maraschino cherries come in. It\u2019s even more often mispronounced than not \u2013 the \u201csch\u201d is a hard \u201csk\u201d sound, so it\u2019s mara-skee-no, not mara-sheen-o. Maraschino is made from marasca cherries, which themselves come from the Dalmatia region of what is now Croatia \u2013 and both the cherries and the Dalmatia region have caused a few complications for the liqueur and its originators, the Italian Luxardo family. Maraschino cherries used to be marasca cherries brined in ocean water and preserved in maraschino liqueur, but they\u2019re now, for the most part, neon-red, syrupy-sweet franken-fruit that have been leached of their natural colour and flavour by calcium-laden brines. (A few brands, most notably Luxardo, make non-alcoholic versions of maraschino cherries that cleave closely to the original template.) The second world war also threw a spanner in the works, as the allies bombed the original Luxardo maraschino factory in Italian-held Zara (now Zadar, Croatia), then Tito\u2019s partisans swept in to secure the city for Yugoslavia. All of which meant that, until relatively recently, it was often quite difficult to acquire maraschino liqueur. There are a few competing brands of note \u2013 including the Croatian Maraska, still made in Zadar \u2013 but I\u2019m a firm believer that the original, in this case, is still the best. As the liqueur has such a powerful and funky flavour, it tends to overwhelm drinks if poured liberally \u2013 I tend to avoid putting more than a quarter-ounce (7.5 ml) in any given drink, unless there\u2019s a very good reason to do so. But once you master the precision required to wield this ingredient well, you\u2019ll soon discover that it has many uses in the bar \u2013 not least of which is adding the signature je ne sais quoi to the classic Hemingway daiquiri. Make it at home: Hemingway daiquiri This recipe is in fact not what Hemingway himself drank. His preferred recipe was really Constantino Ribalaigua Vert\u2019s Daiquiri no. 4, just with double the rum and no sugar \u2013 an unbalanced mess. (Whatever you think about his prose, Hemingway made a better writer than he did a mixologist.) The following is my own recipe that takes inspiration from Ribalaigua Vert\u2019s Daiquiris no. 3 and no. 4, but rebalances the drink so it can be served up in a coupe instead of over crushed ice. If you want a stiffer drink, feel free to bump the rum up to 60 ml. 45 ml white rum 15 ml lime juice 15 ml pink grapefruit juice (unsweetened) 7.5 ml maraschino liqueur (preferably Luxardo) 5 ml (one bar spoon) simple syrup Build all ingredients in a shaker. Add ice and shake to chill. Double strain into a chilled cocktail coupe and either garnish with an authentic maraschino cherry, or leave as unadorned as Hemingway\u2019s prose style. Pair with a book: Philip Greene\u2019s book To Have and Have Another goes into a ludicrous amount of detail about Hemingway\u2019s drinking habits and the drinks that appeared in his writing. 5. Orange liqueur Of all of the useful modifiers to have in your cocktail cabinet at home, this is the one most likely to be there already \u2013 after all, lots of us love a cheeky dram of Cointreau, or keep some Grand Marnier around for cooking. This is great news for the beginner cocktail maker \u2013 orange liqueurs of one sort or another turn up in all sorts of classic cocktails, from the indefatigable margarita through to the stately sidecar and the exotic Pegu Club. There\u2019s a fair bit of terminological confusion about the category \u2013 those who truly wish to geek out about the differences between cura\u00e7aos and triple secs can consult the section devoted to the subject in Andrew Willett\u2019s book Elemental Mixology \u2013 but the take-home is simple: like nearly any kind of spirit, you get what you pay for. Cheap triple secs are one-dimensional and taste like orange Lifesavers; more expensive options, like the aforementioned Cointreau and Grand Marnier or Pierre Ferrand\u2019s excellent dry cura\u00e7ao, taste vibrantly of real oranges, zest and all. Which one you choose for your home liquor cabinet is a matter of personal taste; the only caveat is that Grand Marnier is a little sweeter and more unctuous than its competitors, which means you might want to pour it with a lighter hand. The white lady is one of those cocktails that are infrequently found on cocktail menus in the wild \u2013 probably because it\u2019s one of those drinks that are rarely ordered by customers, and one that bartenders generally think of as a bit of old hat. It is, however, a model of elegance and simplicity, and a cocktail that can be made with commonly found ingredients. One quick note \u2013 depending on the acidity of your lemons and the sweetness of your orange liqueur, you might need to bump up the sweetness of the drink by adding a touch of simple syrup, which you can make by mixing equal parts (by volume) of caster sugar and hot water and stirring until the sugar dissolves. Make it at home: white lady 45 ml gin 22.5 ml orange liqueur 22.5 ml lemon juice One egg white Build all ingredients in a shaker. Shake without ice to fluff up the egg white, then add ice and shake to chill. Taste the cocktail, and add a dash of simple syrup if necessary. Double strain the completed drink into a chilled cocktail coupe and garnish with a twist of lemon peel. Pair with a movie: What else but the BBC\u2019s 1997 adaptation of Wilkie Collins\u2019s The Woman in White?",

      "bodyText": "Japan\u2019s core consumer prices have risen for the first time in over a year thanks to a pickup in energy costs, marking a rare victory in the government\u2019s long battle against deflation. But a slump in household spending showed by 1.2% compared with January last year showed why economic growth and inflation have lagged the more ambitious goals set out by policymakers. As rising protectionism in the United States poses risks for the world\u2019s third-largest economy, as well as the rest of export-reliant Asia, there is a danger companies will shy away from boosting wages seen as crucial for durable growth. That will also undermine the Bank of Japan\u2019s efforts to accelerate inflation to its still-distant 2 percent target, analysts say. Government data showed on Friday that the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.1% in January from a year ago, posting the first increase since December 2015. It compared with a median market forecast for a flat growth and followed a 0.2% drop in December. Many analysts expect core consumer prices to head toward 1% later this year helped by the strengthening US dollar pushing the yen lower. A fall in the currency will make imports more expensive for Japanese consumers, which will boost prices. \u201cInflation will accelerate this year due to a rebound in energy costs and the weak-yen effect. But it won\u2019t heighten much next year unless wages spike and boost spending,\u201d said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. \u201cThe hurdle for hitting 2% inflation remains very high, which means the BOJ will maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy for the time being,\u201d he said. Slow wage growth is weighing on consumer spending \u2013 which accounts for more than a half of Japan\u2019s GDP \u2013 despite a tight jobs market. Unemployment has been at its lowest level in around 20 years. Fresh data on Friday showed the jobless rate edged down from 3.1% in December to 3% in January. This week, Japan posted an unexpected drop in factory output for January, the first fall in six months and the latest red flag for the world\u2019s number three economy. Japan has been struggling to reverse a years-long deflationary spiral of falling prices and lacklustre growth. \u201cThe government is teaming up with the Bank of Japan to keep working toward getting out of deflation,\u201d top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters Friday. Tokyo\u2019s years-long effort to kickstart growth \u2013 a blend of massive monetary easing, government spending and red-tape slashing \u2013 stoked a stock market rally, weakened the yen and fattened corporate profits, but growth in the wider economy remains fragile.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the consumer and wealth division of National Australia Bank received a 36% increase in pay after the division overcharged its superannuation customers by $34.7m. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) reported in February that more than 220,000 member accounts were incorrectly charged planned service fees of approximately $34.7m between September 2012 and October 2016. The bank has had to repay the money to its customers. The evidence was heard in the second round of parliamentary committee hearings into the big four banks, established by the government in response to calls from the Greens, the Labor party, Nick Xenophon Team and One Nation for a banking royal commission. The NAB chief executive officer, Andrew Thorburn, was equivocal during questioning over whether senior executives had been sacked over the issue. He said two executives had left but he was unsure whether they had been sacked or had left of their own accord. He agreed to provide the answer at a later date. However, he said several planners at a lower level had been sacked after previous financial planning scandals. \u201cThere have been 55 planners that we have terminated because of poor conduct between 2009 and 2015,\u201d Thorburn said. \u201cIn that time, we have 4,400 planners. So 55 is too many, not good enough but it\u2019s in the context of 4,400 people, 99% of them are doing the right thing.\u201d He was eventually forced by Liberal committee chair David Coleman to concede that the head of the wealth management division, Andrew Hagger, had received 120% of his bonus last year. Thorburn also confirmed under questioning from Labor\u2019s Matt Thistlethwaite that Hagger received a 36% increase in total salary. A week after the Australia Post managing director Ahmed Fahour resigned after controversy over his $5.6m remuneration package, Thorburn defended Hagger, saying he came to the bank to address problems in the wealth management division. He said Hagger implemented a customer response initiative and was responsible for the sale of 80% of NAB\u2019s life insurance business to Nippon Life for $2.4bn. \u201cThat is a major transaction in the bank, that was a $3bn transaction,\u201d Thorburn said. \u201cAndrew Hagger did a very good job last year.\u201d After the inaugural hearings in October last year, the parliamentary commitee made several recommendations, including that banks should publicly report significant regulatory breaches within five days of reporting the incident to regulators. It recommended that such reports include a description of the breach and how it occurred, the names of senior executives responsible for the teams where the breach occurred and the consequences they faced, and an explanation for why an executive is not dismissed (if they are not). The big banks have rejected that recommendation. Thorburn said that if employees did not meet the standard, they left the company. Coleman told Thorburn he found it \u201cexceptional\u201d that the banks would reject the recommendation on the grounds that employees might not report breaches if they knew they would be publicly reported. \u201cI think what you mean by that is in a scenario where a breach has occurred, if you were required to release that information publicly, you think your people might be inclined not to want to release it and not report the breach at all, which would be compounding one breach with another,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI found that quite exceptional that you would use that as a justification for not wanting to publicly report this information.\u201d Thorburn said the bank would, under existing circumstances, report a breach to Asic but he would prefer an industry-wide response. \u201cIf it does happen, we believe it should be an industry response, a standard industry response. So we\u2019re happy to continue that conversation, but at the moment we believe what we do is appropriate for our clients.\u201d Thorburn is also chairman of the Australian Bankers Association, the chief industry lobby group, which recently appointed the former Queensland Labor premier Anna Bligh as chief executive. On Tuesday, NAB announced the appointment of Mike Baird as a senior executive, one month after he stepped down as New South Wales premier. The Greens MP Adam Bandt asked Thorburn if he understood that those appointments had given the impression \u201cmore than anything in recent times that the big banks and the big political parties are all in this together\u201d. Thorburn rejected his assertion. He said Bligh had an understanding of people, given her record as premier reacting to the 2011 Queensland floods and as chief executive of the Young Women\u2019s Christian Association. He said Baird was a former corporate banker whose skills fitted the position. In the absence of government support for a royal commission, the Greens are pushing for a rare parliamentary commission of inquiry, overseen by judges.

      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull lost more than his voice this week, he washed up on the losing side of a critical political battle. The Coalition came back from the summer with a simple political strategy: strand Labor uncomfortably on energy policy between its inner city progressive supporters and its traditional working base. This was Turnbull\u2019s big political fightback \u2013 energy prices, energy security, eyes firmly on the household \u2013 to paint Labor into the green-left corner and the mad incompetence corner, with a hip-pocket hook that voters could connect to. Energy fightback was always a house of cards on the substance, and the government initially overplayed the negative rhetoric on renewables \u2013 which it later had to correct \u2013 but at least it was something to talk about. Right-aligned media and the usual talkback ranters were busy amplifying the government\u2019s line obediently, and government backbenchers had their tails up for the first time since they all almost lost the election. The funereal atmosphere around the government lifted, briefly. Then along came the penalty rates decision. Despite having months to war-game a response, the government had no clear strategy \u2013 or none in evidence in any case \u2013 once the news came through that some of the lowest paid workers would be getting a pay cut. The only plan in evidence was to blame Bill Shorten, which voters don\u2019t give a stuff about. If you are a government, you are supposed to do things, fix things, not snivel like a toddler about whose fault it is. Right in front of our eyes, the government worked through its various feelpinions and cascading reactions, as if it was processing the various stages of grief. Some in the government were astonished to hear the prime minister on 3AW last week going full empathy with the affected workers, rather than focusing on the broader economic rationale for the decision. Then there was the sophistry of supporting the tribunal but not the decision itself. It took a couple of days to mount the argument Scott Morrison eventually crafted \u2013 which is that workers can\u2019t work in businesses that can\u2019t afford to stay open and offer them the hours. By week\u2019s end, the government was in the first stage of retreat. Perhaps the Fair Work Commission would phase in the cuts to penalty rates over several years to offset the proposed reduction in take-home pay. Turnbull told reporters the government was \u201cvery supportive of the commission managing this transition in a way that ensures that take-home pay is, as far as possible, maintained\u201d. So to cut a long story short, the week was another hot mess. But that\u2019s not the worst of it for the government. The big blow of the penalty rates decision is its potential to neutralise its big energy wedge. Labor now has its own equal and opposite campaign to help burnish its credentials with working people \u2013 a campaign that says this government doesn\u2019t care if your wages get cut, and won\u2019t care if this penalty rates decision flows on to other industries. You can summarise the tag line as: \u201cYou could be next.\u201d That\u2019s potent at a time when Australians are fretful, for very sound reasons, about their income security and their job security. Labor can also deliver the campaign, boosted by the union movement and progressive activist groups \u2013 institutional power which the government well understands, having been to this rodeo once or twice before. I\u2019ve mentioned more than once that Shorten is one of the luckiest people I\u2019ve seen in 20 years covering politics. Quite reasonably, he would counsel me that this is more than luck \u2013 it\u2019s about hard work, dare we say being agile, and about translating opportunities. On the same day this week that Malcolm Turnbull got uncomfortably hoarse at the dispatch box, I watched Shorten hit cruising altitude at a town hall meeting in Canberra. Shorten is looking like a man who believes the political times suit him. He\u2019s in stride, not breaking a sweat. The times do suit him. But one of the most underreported realities in Canberra at the moment, courtesy of the government\u2019s cascading woes, is the interesting cross-current beginning to form in Labor about where the party positions itself for the next election. The ALP did a lot of heavy policy work in the last term of opposition, and the current caucus is studded with bright next-generation types who are keen to keep pushing the policy envelope \u2013 as well as beginning to discover the wing span of their factional power. A bunch of up-and-coming leftwingers \u2013 and one prominent rightwinger, the former treasurer Wayne Swan \u2013 have a burning fire in their belly about rising inequality, and there are already nascent internal conflicts about how assertively progressive Labor needs to be by the time the next poll rolls round. This is a debate the centre-left is having right around the world as it attempts to counter the rise of the reactionary right. The centre-left is struggling to remain relevant to the working people drifting in the direction of reactionary rightwing populists, who peddle empathy. The right is busy recruiting globalisation\u2019s biggest losers by feeling their pain and validating their anger, and more pain is coming, with the inexorable rise of automation. Swan delivered a speech on that theme this week that you would characterise as fully fired up. Take my advice. Watch that space. I reckon it will be worth watching.",

The quarry, which operated until 1980, lies about 30 minutes from Adelaide\u2019s city centre on the land of the Kaurna people, an Indigenous group almost completely eradicated by the European occupation of South Australia in 1836. And on Thursday evening, as the sun began to set and cold wind blew through the gully, it became a silent character and an awe-inspiring backdrop to Adelaide festival\u2019s opening event: a restaging of Neil Armfield\u2019s adaptation of Kate Grenville\u2019s acclaimed 2005 novel The Secret River. The Helpmann award-winning production, which premiered for Sydney Theatre company in 2013, tells the story of settlement from the perspective of poor convict William Thornhill (Nathaniel Dean), his wife Sal (Georgia Adamson) and their two sons, by way of the all-seeing narration of Ningali Lawford-Wolf, who plays Dhirrumbin. It\u2019s 1813 and Thornhill has earned his freedom in Sydney, and travels up the Hawkesbury river to find 100 acres to build a life upon. As his family grapple with the land and becomes increasingly aware of the Indigenous family already living upon it, the arrogance with which Thornhill decides the place is his \u2013 dismissing or ignoring all evidence to the contrary \u2013 escalates into a violent tragedy, with innumerable consequences. Told outdoors and on country, the story and its consequences weighed heavy for the opening night audience: the lives shed in the bloody battle between an ancient culture that owned the land and the invaders who had no right to it. Music carries the play\u2019s emotional heft, and in the windy outdoors it washed through the natural amphitheatre with hardly a glitch. Multi-instrumentalist and composer Iain Grandage underscored the action with sensitivity and humour, and the mournful, moving Indigenous song which opened and closed the play \u2013 sung first by elder Yalamundi (Stephen Goldsmith), and later by the sole Indigenous survivor Ngalamalum (Shaka Cook) \u2013 bounced off the quarry stone, resonating long after the play had ended.

But it\u2019s also a movement that empowers individuals, often at the expense of the collective. The result is a blend of capitalism and feminism that feeds successful women into a patriarchal power structure of money, comfort and privilege but does not do much to improve the lives of many women who still live with capitalism\u2019s boot on their neck.</p> <p> Crispin writes that in feminism\u2019s pursuit of mainstream acceptability, it\u2019s lost a lot of its power and kick: \u201cFor something to be universally accepted, it must become as banal, as non-threatening and ineffective as possible.\u201d</p> <p> The book invokes the radical spirit of feminism\u2019s second wave \u2013 a generation of feminists widely disowned by the younger generation.

More recently, Australia\u2019s most famous feminist, Germaine Greer, has raised the ire of contemporary feminists with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/12/germaine-greer-tells-qa-her-trans-views-were-wrong-but-then-restates-them\">comments relating to trans people and identities</a>. </p> <p> \u201cTo understand how on-the-surface contemporary feminism really is,\u201d Crispin writes, \u201cwe only need note that the most common markers of feminism\u2019s success are the same markers of success in patriarchal capitalism.\u201d</p> <p> Crispin\u2019s polemic is timely. If the election of Donald Trump indicates a failure of a feminist project to completely and thoroughly cut through to the mainstream (all those women in the so-called flyover states who voted for a \u201cpussy-grabbing\u201d president) \u2013 and the hugely successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/21/donald-trump-first-24-hours-global-protests-dark-speech-healthcare\">Women\u2019s March</a> points to the movement\u2019s green shoots \u2013 Crispin\u2019s book has arrived at a time when there is an appetite for radicalism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"257e0c419f35b0f382355e3220f9e957b2eeab49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/257e0c419f35b0f382355e3220f9e957b2eeab49/0_0_520_804/323.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image of Why I Am Not a Feminist by Jessa Crispin\" width=\"323\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is an edited version of a conversation Crispin had with Guardian Australia this week in the lead-up to her Australian tour.<br /></p> <p><strong>Where did the idea for the book come from? Did it come out of a moment of rage with contemporary feminism or was it more gradual?</strong><br /></p> <p> It wasn\u2019t any one incident, it was more of a growing frustration. For the past five to 10 years I\u2019ve just been one of those book critics \u2013 if a publication has a feminist book they want reviewed \u2013 they send me to do it. So I was reading a lot of feminist literature and it was getting more and more shallow, so there was a building dissatisfaction.</p> <p><strong>How did you come to feminism? Was it through 90s feminists such as Naomi Wolf or did you connect via the second wave, such as Dworkin?</strong><br /></p> <p> My political awakening came through feminism. I come from a very conservative town and family and I was coming of age in the third wave but I didn\u2019t have access to it. There were maybe eight books in the town library and they were Stephen King books. Then in my 20s I took a job at Planned Parenthood, part of which was working in the library. In my reading, I really moved back and forth between the decades and waves \u2013 everything from biology textbooks to riot grrrl zines. It was a more scattered education than other people. Shulamith Firestone was one of the first feminist writers I felt really connected to, and Susan Faludi. A lot of queer theory was helpful to me too.</p> <p><strong>So what was your real-life experience of feminism when you were growing up in middle America?</strong><br /></p> <p> Second-wave feminism did not happen in my hometown and the third wave was happening in some places \u2013 but not in Kansas. That is a problem that people have with contemporary feminism. They think we solved the problems tackled by the second wave.</p> <p><strong>How do you define the lifestyle feminism that you critique in the book \u2013 and why is it bad?</strong><br /></p> <p> The primary problem I have with it is that is focused primarily on the individual \u2013 it\u2019s your way of dealing with your own life. There\u2019s very little sense of solidarity. You use feminism to ask for a raise at work, or negotiate your romantic relationships \u2013 but you don\u2019t use it to negotiate the shared experience that minorities have or to renegotiate capitalism. There is less of an understanding of the big picture and more instead of how you are doing as an individual. It\u2019s a very inward movement \u2013 and very individualistic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/25/rebel-crossings-sheila-rowbotham-review-feminist-womens-marches\">Rebel Crossings by Sheila Rowbotham review \u2013 feminist utopian dreams</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Like the way that women talk about self-care?</strong><br /></p> <p> Self-care has definitely changed in its meaning.

      "bodyText": "I admit I picked up Why I Am Not a Feminist, a new polemic by the US writer Jessa Crispin, thinking she was some sort of female men\u2019s rights activist and the book was arguing for a winding back of women\u2019s rights. I was wrong. This is a gutsy and bracing book arguing that contemporary feminism has lost its way, and no longer has much in common with its revolutionary roots. For an age, Crispin writes, gains for women were made by a \u201csmall number of radical, heavily invested women who did the hard work of dragging women\u2019s position forward, usually through shocking acts and words\u201d, and that the \u201cmajority of women benefited from the work of these few, while often quickly trying to disassociate themselves from them\u201d. Last year, after closing her popular, long-running literary blog Bookslut, Crispin gave an interview to Vulture in which she said: \u201cContemporary feminism is not only embarrassing but incredibly misguided to the point where I can\u2019t associate myself with it.\u201d The type of feminism Crispin is critiquing can loosely be described as lifestyle feminism: a \u201cdecade-long conversation about which television show is a good television show and which television show is a bad show\u201d. But it\u2019s also a movement that empowers individuals, often at the expense of the collective. The result is a blend of capitalism and feminism that feeds successful women into a patriarchal power structure of money, comfort and privilege but does not do much to improve the lives of many women who still live with capitalism\u2019s boot on their neck. Crispin writes that in feminism\u2019s pursuit of mainstream acceptability, it\u2019s lost a lot of its power and kick: \u201cFor something to be universally accepted, it must become as banal, as non-threatening and ineffective as possible.\u201d The book invokes the radical spirit of feminism\u2019s second wave \u2013 a generation of feminists widely disowned by the younger generation. In Australia we saw a version of this matricide this play out with Helen Garner\u2019s book, The First Stone, in the 1990s. (Garner is mentioned in Why I\u2019m Not a Feminist\u2019s acknowledgements.)

If the election of Donald Trump indicates a failure of a feminist project to completely and thoroughly cut through to the mainstream (all those women in the so-called flyover states who voted for a \u201cpussy-grabbing\u201d president) \u2013 and the hugely successful Women\u2019s March points to the movement\u2019s green shoots \u2013 Crispin\u2019s book has arrived at a time when there is an appetite for radicalism. This is an edited version of a conversation Crispin had with Guardian Australia this week in the lead-up to her Australian tour. Where did the idea for the book come from?
