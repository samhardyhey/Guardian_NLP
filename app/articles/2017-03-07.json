So finding a new and bigger home was front and centre for us.</p> <p>\u201cWe also wanted a bit of space for the kids to grow up in \u2013 with a big yard.

In hindsight, these were things we could have planned and saved for, just like we did a deposit for a house.\u201d</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest surprise of all for the Hornerys, has been the cost of childcare. After the birth of Olivia, Samantha had six months off work \u2013 partly covered by paid maternity leave \u2013 before returning to her role as business manager for a property developer part-time. Initially, the grandparents helped out with looking after the baby, which Samantha says was both an emotional and financial blessing. </p> <p>However, it wasn\u2019t long before Samantha was back at work full-time, so the couple needed to make some big decisions regarding their jobs and childcare. </p> <p>\u201cThe biggest shock for us has been the childcare costs,\u201d says Samantha. \u201cI commute to work in Brisbane so the girls go to childcare there two days a week and it costs us $880 a month.</p> <p>\u201cLuckily, my workplace has been really supportive and my job is flexible enough that I can work from home two to three days a week. But it does mean I juggle work around the children more.\u201d </p> <p>Indeed, after the birth of Aurelia 18 months ago, the couple realised just how much of a juggling act it would be now that their family had grown to four. It prompted them to make further changes \u2013 with Ben leaving his role as a public land and design co-ordinator on the Gold Coast to start his own landscape architecture consultancy business so he could work from home and help look after the children.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we had the second baby, we made a decision that Samantha\u2019s job was financially stronger than mine and she had more flexibility to work from home,\u201d Ben explains. \u201cSo it made sense for her to continue full-time and for me to be at home more with the kids rather than putting them into childcare for extra days.</p> <p>\u201cThis had a big impact on us financially. Especially initially while I was setting up my business. Things were a bit tight at times.

I\u2019ve actually got no objection now to building something but build it on leasehold land, don\u2019t let them try and claim freehold land,\u201d Douglas said.</p> <p>Gates said she was unaware of issues around freehold land as the council had not been briefed yet by the state government about the proposal\u2019s latest form.</p> <p>\u201cAnything that creates the level of employment that\u2019s being suggested will obviously be welcome on the Gold Coast,\u201d Gates said.</p> <p>\u201cBut the specifics of that particular project are not clear to the council at this point in time. I\u2019m hopeful that the state and council can work together to master plan that area because it seems to be a priority for the community.</p> <p>\u201cI think everyone is united in wanting to ensure that [the Spit] remains available for community access into the future.\u201d </p>",

Asked about fresh financial questions around a major proposal for the Gold Coast, Donna Gates, the city\u2019s deputy mayor, said she expected \u201cthe state government will do its due diligence about [ASF\u2019s] ability to deliver as part of the whole process\u201d. The plans have been long opposed on various grounds by local community group Save Our Spit Alliance, which has previously raised issues about the corporate structure and wherewithal of ASF with Queensland\u2019s Department of State Development. Steve Gration, the president of the community group, said the latest financial report raised questions about the diligence of the government\u2019s previous probity checks. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that a company that has capital of less than $6m, that has only five employees that we can locate \u2013 and they\u2019re all directors of the company \u2013 is wanting to take on coalmining, property development, and in particular this integrated resort development,\u201d Gration said. \u201cThat\u2019s with no experience, no staff, limited expertise and certainly no capital to invest of their own. \u201cWe\u2019ve been informing the Department of State Development over four years that financially, they are a shell company that seem to trawl for projects in Australia and either on-sell them or invite more financial companies, in particular Chinese state government companies, to join them once they\u2019ve got the green light projects. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a very dubious way for governments in Australia to do business.\u201d A spokesman for the Queensland Department of State Development said the government would take into account the financial capacity of members of the ASF Consortium \u2013 a wholly owned subsidiary of ASF \u2013 when weighing up the casino proposal. \u201cIn assessing the commercial viability of the consortium proposal, the government will consider the financial capacity of individual members as well as the wider consortium,\u201d the spokesman told the Australian. One-time Newman government MP Alex Douglas, a vocal critic of the casino proposal, said ASF\u2019s low current cash reserves were less significant than they might seem as \u201cthere\u2019s never been any money there\u201d. \u201cBut when it comes down to it, those companies [backing ASF as investors] will put the money up,\u201d he said. Douglas said the state government should be wary of allowing ASF to claim freehold land \u201cfor nothing\u201d under a loophole that allows a developer to claim it in certain circumstances when the footprint of buildings encroaches into the space beyond the Spit shoreline. \u201cThis is all about a land grab. I\u2019ve actually got no objection now to building something but build it on leasehold land, don\u2019t let them try and claim freehold land,\u201d Douglas said. Gates said she was unaware of issues around freehold land as the council had not been briefed yet by the state government about the proposal\u2019s latest form. \u201cAnything that creates the level of employment that\u2019s being suggested will obviously be welcome on the Gold Coast,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut the specifics of that particular project are not clear to the council at this point in time. I\u2019m hopeful that the state and council can work together to master plan that area because it seems to be a priority for the community. \u201cI think everyone is united in wanting to ensure that [the Spit] remains available for community access into the future.\u201d",

Apologies for the depressing start, but even more so, I\u2019m so very sorry for the mothers whose babies will die today, and for all 2,200 Australian families this year that will lose a baby through stillbirth. 8 March is International Women\u2019s Day.

      "bodyText": "Incorrect assumptions are being made that gender equality has been achieved despite disturbing and comprehensive evidence to the contrary, an investigation by Australia\u2019s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, has found. Her findings include the experiences of more than 1,000 women who she interviewed while travelling to every state and territory over a six-month period last year to learn about Australia\u2019s progress towards gender equality. \u201cI did this report because you need to know you need to know the lay of the land before you make progress,\u201d Jenkins told Guardian Australia. \u201cI think that probably one of the most surprising and concerning findings was just how prevalent the opposition to advancing gender equality is.\u201d After speaking to women and reviewing existing research, Jenkins found there were three key areas where equality was particularly lacking and where more progress was needed. They were gender economic security, leadership positions and violence against women. \u201cSome people are adamantly opposed to proactive initiatives to improve gender equality,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cOther people truly don\u2019t understand this is still problem for Australia. \u201cThey\u2019re not actively working against equality but there is a sense in the broader community that gender equality has been achieved, which means there is no real motivation for people to do things differently or to promote women or highlight their stories.\u201d One of the stories highlighted in the report was the experience of a woman named Lyn, who works as a cleaner in a hospital. She told Jenkins she regularly experienced sexual harassment from doctors and patients. On one occasion a patient called Lyn into his room, where he sat naked with an erection. \u201cHer colleagues, including her manager, assumed that she was sexually involved with the patient,\u201d the report said. \u201cLyn tried to report an unrelated instance of sexual harassment by a colleague\u2019s husband but her manager did not take her seriously. After eight years of employment, Lyn thinks that she will have to resign from her job.\u201d Jenkins said for many women she spoke with, the repercussions for speaking up and reporting harassment or inequality to their managers were worse than the discrimination and harassment itself. A female employee told Jenkins she had been labelled \u201chysterical\u201d for calling out sexism. Another woman told Jenkins she lost shifts in her casual employment because she was unable to find care for her children at short notice. A plumber started her own business after failing to receive a single callback for job applications despite being overqualified. And a young woman in a suburban area was encouraged to pursue childcare or be a barista rather than apply for a trades apprenticeship. Women working in rural and remote areas were particularly vulnerable to inequality, Jenkins found. One young woman told her how she was asked to wear a bikini while fruit picking to get paid a bonus. Jenkins heard stories of women not being taken seriously or experiencing sexual harassment in these areas in particular. \u201cA lot of the rural women were really facing greater barriers to women in metro areas,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to lump all women together as a homogenous group of white, Anglo-Saxon, heterosexual, able-bodied people, many who feel they are breaking down some of those barriers to equality. \u201cBut there are many different voices in this, and my voice is tied to having spoken to rural women, LGBTI women, older women, women with disabilities, migrant women and Aboriginal women.\u201d Research shows that women with disabilities are 40% more likely than women without disabilities to be the victims of domestic violence; and that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are 32 times more likely to be admitted to hospital as a result of family violence-related assault than non-Indigenous women in Australia. The report noted that Australia\u2019s long history of removing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their parents had left young women scared to take their babies to hospitals when they are unwell because they fear having their children removed from their custody. \u201cIt took a woman like Rosie Batty to make people understand and be aware of family violence, and key to that was her experience was supported by overwhelming evidence and facts,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cPeople do need to hear individual experiences and that\u2019s what this report tries to do. It tried to document those lived experiences and help those not touched by inequality in their everyday lives to realise deeply embedded barriers to change still remain. And that behind these stories, there is clear data.\u201d One woman, named Sonia, told Jenkins how after she became pregnant, her partner regularly raped her and emotionally manipulated her to convince her his behaviour was acceptable. The findings were launched on Wednesday to coincide with International Women\u2019s Day. Jenkins said it was distressing to see the same arguments emerge each year that having a day for women was biased against men and unnecessary. \u201cYou see the conversations with people asking; \u2018Where is men\u2019s day?\u2019 Well first of all, there is one. It\u2019s in November. And the fact is we still see women underrepresented on honour rolls around the country. \u201cUntil recently, women had to stop playing AFL at 13 or 14 if they were wanting to play at the highest levels, because there was nowhere for them to advance to. We have research from workforces like the Australian federal police and from surgeons highlighting inequality and discrimination. \u201cThe Word Economic Forum ranks countries for female economic participation and Australia ranks number 46.\u201d Jenkins\u2019 report also found there were still fewer opportunities for women when it came to career development, progression and leadership in casual employment. One female academic interviewed noted that although promotions are supposed to be considered in light of achievement relative to opportunity, in reality promotions were based on how many papers an individual had produced, which disadvantaged women on parental leave or with caring responsibilities. But the report was not entirely depressing, Jenkins said. In her foreword she wrote that in her consultations around the country she had also heard about \u201cingenious ways individuals are working to overcome structural biases and unhelpful stereotypes in order to improve opportunities for women and girls\u201d. \u201cAgain and again I witnessed tremendous resilience from women overcoming the entrenched obstacles to their progress, and men stepping up beside women to advance gender equality,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "One of the most popular, acclaimed and inspiring American films of the last few months has been Hidden Figures, the true story of three African American women whose exceptional mathematical and engineering skills were essential to the development of the US space program. The movie shows how they struggled to overcome the pervasively held, unenlightened assumptions of early 1960s America: that neither women nor African Americans \u2013 let alone African American women \u2013 had a place in the brainy world of rocket science. Ultimately (spoiler alert, though this will hardly surprise anyone), the superior intellects of the film\u2019s three protagonists led to huge breakthroughs. As we observe International Women\u2019s Day, it\u2019s worth reflecting on at least two big lessons from Hidden Figures. First, while each of the film\u2019s heroines possessed extraordinary intellects (one was so gifted at math that she enrolled in college in her early teens), they could not have gone anywhere without education. Indeed, the film shows how each fought for schooling typically beyond the reach of African America women of their generation. Second, when we fail to educate all girls and women, the world loses out. The film tells us, for example, that launching the first American into orbit may not have happened (or maybe not as soon) if one of the featured women had not come up with pioneering, complex calculations that eluded her white male co-workers. That moment arguably helped accelerated US progress in its \u201cspace race\u201d against the Soviets and led to many later advances. Considering that approximately 130 million girls worldwide are not attending primary through upper-secondary school and that women represent nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s illiterate, we must ask: how many other innovations and inventions \u2013 great and small \u2013 have been lost to the world because so many minds are idle on the sidelines of human progress? Rumana, a 26-year-old Sudanese mother, asked herself a similar question. Having never been to school as a child herself, she was frustrated that she could not offer her children help with their homework. She decided, along with her friend Madga, to start taking lessons at home to learn what she never had as a kid. Eventually both enrolled in a local third-grade class. Soon, Rumana and Madga started a small ice-cream business, giving them a small income. Now in seventh grade, their small business is going, they continue school and are able to support their children\u2019s learning more actively. Based on what we know about the power of educating girls and women, Rumana and Magda are shortening the odds that they can pull themselves and their families out of desperate poverty and live relatively healthy lives. Their personal gains, together with those of growing numbers of other educated women, reverberate across communities, countries, regions and continents and can truly change the world. Also, as more girls get basic schooling, larger numbers will move up the educational ladder, some to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics. That\u2019s important because workplaces around the world, especially in many developing and emerging market countries, are becoming more automated, favouring workers with technical skills. Their success in the workplace will, in turn, strengthen their countries\u2019 economies and create more and better opportunities for businesses. But, even though the disparity between the number of girls and boys in primary and secondary school has narrowed significantly in many countries, girls\u2019 enrolment and performance in science and math programs still fall far behind boys\u2019. To reverse that trend we need, at many levels, gender-responsive interventions, like those the Global Partnership for Education has supported in developing countries for 15 years. Not just for the girls themselves, who stand to realise their full potential of their otherwise hidden gifts, but also for the world, which profits greatly from investments in girls\u2019 education.

Oh my goodness \u2013 simply one of the most beautiful, haunting, weirdy landscapes I have ever had the good fortune to go and look at. The Port Davey marine reserve is huge, three times the size of Sydney Harbour and that is just the wet bits. </p> <p>The landscape is dominated by numerous ridiculous golden grey green mountain ranges barging about, each covered with white quartzite rocks and cliffs and boulders thrusting out of them, from their tops right down to the harbours and bays and channels. Beautiful white quartzite sandy beaches and button grass plains covered in button grass. There is goddamn button grass everywhere you look, nothing wrong with that, though, there are worse plants \u2013 like the cactus I found in a plastic bag on the street a few years ago. I took it home and stuck it in a pot and it lived! I call it the Evil Space Cactus because it is the most ferocious prickly bastard you can\u2019t go anywhere near it. It is getting huge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d894f795f6652e04787a777777e8ac65fb5a78c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d894f795f6652e04787a777777e8ac65fb5a78c0/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Port Davey Marine Reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Port Davey marine reserve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: First Dog on the Moon for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anyway, in this bit of Tasmania there is a permanent thick layer of peat under everything, and as the freshwater runs through it on its way to the sea, it turns brown from all the tannins. Like some sort of gigantic open-air cup-of-tea factory. </p> <p>Then, and this is the weirdest part, because all the waterways are tidal saltwater, when the tea-coloured freshwater runs into the various bays it sits in a layer on top of the denser salty water below. The tannin layer can be between one and four metres deep. It doesn\u2019t mix in until it gets to the actual Southern Ocean. It is called stratification (science). </p> <p>Why do we care? Because it is interesting! The cup-of-tea water is low in oxygen, light and nutrients so you don\u2019t get much algae or plankton which is a huge bummer to most fish and that is why they don\u2019t live there. But there ARE some proper deep-sea creatures that do live underneath the tannin layer in the saltwater because it is dark like deep in the ocean but just near the surface or something.

      "bodyText": "I went to south-west Tasmania and totally freaked out. Oh my goodness \u2013 simply one of the most beautiful, haunting, weirdy landscapes I have ever had the good fortune to go and look at. The Port Davey marine reserve is huge, three times the size of Sydney Harbour and that is just the wet bits. The landscape is dominated by numerous ridiculous golden grey green mountain ranges barging about, each covered with white quartzite rocks and cliffs and boulders thrusting out of them, from their tops right down to the harbours and bays and channels. Beautiful white quartzite sandy beaches and button grass plains covered in button grass. There is goddamn button grass everywhere you look, nothing wrong with that, though, there are worse plants \u2013 like the cactus I found in a plastic bag on the street a few years ago. I took it home and stuck it in a pot and it lived! I call it the Evil Space Cactus because it is the most ferocious prickly bastard you can\u2019t go anywhere near it. It is getting huge. Anyway, in this bit of Tasmania there is a permanent thick layer of peat under everything, and as the freshwater runs through it on its way to the sea, it turns brown from all the tannins. Like some sort of gigantic open-air cup-of-tea factory. Then, and this is the weirdest part, because all the waterways are tidal saltwater, when the tea-coloured freshwater runs into the various bays it sits in a layer on top of the denser salty water below. The tannin layer can be between one and four metres deep. It doesn\u2019t mix in until it gets to the actual Southern Ocean. It is called stratification (science). Why do we care? Because it is interesting! The cup-of-tea water is low in oxygen, light and nutrients so you don\u2019t get much algae or plankton which is a huge bummer to most fish and that is why they don\u2019t live there. But there ARE some proper deep-sea creatures that do live underneath the tannin layer in the saltwater because it is dark like deep in the ocean but just near the surface or something. AMAZING! You can see the high-tide line without any trouble because the tannin stains the quartzite. A team of researchers from the First Dog on the Moon Institute first came to the Melaleuca lagoon at the western end of Port Davey reserve in January this year as guests of the Difficult Bird Research Group. The DBRG are a ragtag crew of ne\u2019er-do-wells and bird scientists who we first met during their (still ongoing) campaign to save the extremely unhelpful swift parrot \u2013 the institute donated some adorable cartoon prints and they raised millions of dollars (give or take a few millions of dollars). Now the DBRG have turned their attention to the even more ridiculous and endangered orange-bellied parrot \u2013 both of these birds are the only migratory parrots in the world and extremely difficult to keep alive. But at least the DBRG are having a red hot crack at it. Lovely people. To get to Port Davey you either have to come in on a boat (we do not have a boat), or walk from Tasmania\u2019s southernmost town Picklebum Cove* \u2013 a death-defying journey of six days away from the nearest shop, stomping (sustainably) through vicious empty wilderness. Or fly like we did in a tiny tiny tiny plane piloted by someone who I am pretty sure was 12 years old. The airline Par Avion (who flew us in FOR FREE IT WAS A MONSTROUS JUNKET AHAHAHAHA) are the only people who fly their planes into the Melaleuca airstrip \u2013 they fly all the bird scientists for free as well so they are very nice and that is why I am saying nice things about them not because we got a FREE HOLIDAY. Prove that I lie. It is apparently company policy to hire EXTREMELY YOUTHFUL PLANE DRIVERS so it is not terrifying at all hurtling through the air at 15,000 feet in what feels like a Toyota HiAce with wings and a propeller with a tween in the pilot seat. The pilot who flew us out the last time had an enormous and magnificent red bushranger beard but I wasn\u2019t fooled, I assumed it was fake, and that he would rip it from his face just before we took off and say: \u201cAhahaha I\u2019m not really a pilot, I am 11. Your real pilot is over there hiding behind that tea tree shrub.\u201d That being said, all the pilots have been extremely professional, very good at planes and also quite charming, it was not their fault I thought I was going to die. The first time saw the tiny gravel airstrip at Melaleuca I thought it was a lake and that we would fly around a nearby mountain and there would be the proper airstrip. When I realised it was a patch of gravel and not a lake I still thought we would fly around a nearby mountain to the proper airstrip. But we did not. Because the weather was so mild** when our pilot flew us in this time, we were able to stay extremely terrifyingly low zooming REALLY CLOSE to mountain tops and various bits of ruinous beautiful coastline. Spectacular. I reckon it was the best flight I have ever taken in a plane. It was even better than the time I flew a jet with my own bare hands and I\u2019m not even joking \u2013 ask my friend Steve the Jet Guy \u2013 I really did. Par Avion runs an extremely sustainable camp up the estuary \u2013 we spent two nights there and three days pootling about rivers and bays in a zippy boat sort of thing with the charming and knowledgeable Greg and my friend Mark who is a bird scientist (and also camping guide). I had never met Mark in person before, just on bird twitter, where he is @neophema1. Knows loads of bird stuff. Great bloke. Has a predatory mite named after him (Nidilaelaps holdsworthi) also known as Holdsworth\u2019s nest-dog mite. It was discovered in orange-bellied parrot nests and is probably a beneficial predator of parasitic bird mites. But who isn\u2019t these days? The whole thing is all unspeakably beautiful \u2013 I almost got bored with how incessantly gorgeous and amazing it was. And full of ridiculous creatures too. Things like: The Maugean skate \u2013 a fish (Zearaja maugeana) which ONLY LIVES IN BATHURST HARBOUR! NOWHERE ELSE ON EARTH! Apparently known as the thylacine of the sea according to Google. (We did not see one of these.) They have things called sea pens (Sarcoptilus grandis)\u2013 they look like a giant mutant quill pen \u2013 unlikely frondy whatsits that filter their lunch out of the water, I said no this is a pretend thing you made up but they showed me a picture in a book. (We did not see any of these either \u2013 except in the book) The orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster) officially designated a \u201cmoron\u201d by one of Australia\u2019s premier bird experts \u2013 we saw quite a few orange-bellied parrots \u2013 in one tree there were four at one time and Mark said that is 10% of the world\u2019s wild population. Sad. Bladderworts (Utricularia monanthos) \u2013 these are lovely purple flowers (sometimes known as fairy aprons) that grow out of the mud (there is a lot of mud) they are insectivores and their roots eat tiny worms (nemotodes). Sundews \u2013 also growing in the mud and also insectivores \u2013 they eat bugs or something I don\u2019t know do I have to do everything? Go and google it I\u2019ll wait here. Cusk eel \u2013 a kind of eel (didn\u2019t see one). The bastard trumpeter \u2013 a fish we also did not see but did laugh its stupid name. (Latridopsis forsteri). Boobook (Ninox leucopsis) \u2013 an owl (we saw one \u2013 it makes a noise like \u2026 wait for it \u2026 Boobook! Hilariously there is also an owl called a Morepork which we heard but did not see \u2013 it makes a noise like \u2026 wait for it \u2026 Morepork! Aaahahahahaha owls). The \u201cbird scientists\u201d say the Boobook and the Morepork are the same thing, and that the Boobook isn\u2019t even a Boobook it\u2019s a New Zealand Morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae) which is ridiculous because one says Boobook and the other says Morepork. Huon pine (is actually a tree) \u2013 saw lots including one that was around 1,500 years old!! (Lagarostrobos franklinii). Pademelon (Thylogale billardierii) not a fruit but a marsupial \u2013 saw one of these AND IT HAD A BABY ONE OMG! There is a lot of white people history to look at and talk about: the late naturalist and tin miner Deny King (famous for loads of interesting stuff) and his friends and relations, also tin mining, whaling, huon pine chopper-downers, and tons of boat action over the years. Aboriginal history is less prominent although there are a few things, Aboriginal people had been here for 35,000 years apparently. We saw an ochre cave that the locals had dug something like 6,000 years ago, it had an excellent midden of mud oysters. It was strange a feeling moving through a landscape that looked the same today as it did 6,000 years ago. The button grass moorlands that extend far beyond the marine reserve were burnt for many thousands of years by Aboriginal people. Without the burning, the moorlands will eventually turn to forest and then rainforest. Today Aboriginal people in Tasmania take an active role in managing the landscape and maintaining some of the cultural traditions of their ancestors. It is interesting and unexpected that the whole place hasn\u2019t been trashed. A third of Tasmania is world heritage-listed and half the state is some kind of reserve or national park***. It is a happy confluence of things that has kept this part of the south-west free of resorts and dickheads \u2013 no fish, no road, the soil is all mean and unhelpful former quartzite, it is allegedly freezing most of the time**, nothing of value to dig up or chop down (except for the occasional huon pine). Perfect really. It is just crap enough to keep people away. As Greg our host said, \u201cIf there was anything good here, there\u2019d be apple trees and cows and a four-lane highway leading to a small city.\u201d But there isn\u2019t. It is a remarkable piece of the world, and you should see it if you can. I did. * Not actually called Picklebum Cove but it might as well be because you\u2019ve never heard of it anyway ** During most of my visits to Tasmania the weather has been lovely or at least not terrible. Tasmanians keep going on about how cold and wet it is all the time but I am not so sure. Perhaps they are trying to keep people away *** A lot of the facts in this article come from things I read on the internet or that people said to me and they may or may not be true. Even though I pretend to be a journalist I am actually a cartoonist and that means I am allowed to make things up and be wrong \u2022 First Dog on the Moon was a guest of Par Avion Airlines and reckons it would have been lovely holiday even if it wasn\u2019t free but it was",

      "bodyText": "North Korea has banned Malaysian citizens from leaving the country, and Malaysia has responded with a tit-for-tat ban in an escalation of the row over the killing of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s half-brother in Kuala Lumpur. The state news agency in North Korea cited a foreign ministry statement saying all Malaysians \u201cwill be temporarily prohibited from leaving the country until the incident that happened in Malaysia is properly solved\u201d. Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Najib Razak, called it an \u201cabhorrent act, effectively holding our citizens hostage\u201d in disregard of international law. He said he had instructed police to prevent all North Korean citizens in Malaysia from leaving until the safety of Malaysians in North Korea was assured. Malaysia\u2019s foreign ministry said it had 11 citizens in North Korea, including three embassy staff, six family members and two others. Neither country has announced how many North Koreans live in Malaysia. A Malaysian police investigation into the murder of Kim Jong-nam at Kuala Lumpur airport last month has infuriated Pyongyang and named seven North Koreans wanted for questioning by police. Three North Korean nationals wanted in connection with the killing are hiding in the country\u2019s embassy, Malaysia\u2019s chief of police said on Tuesday. An employee for North Korea\u2019s state airline named as a suspect and a senior diplomat called in for questioning are believed to be inside the embassy. \u201cWe are trying to physically identify all the embassy staff who are here,\u201d the deputy Malaysian home minister, Nur Jazlan Mohamed, told reporters outside the North Korean embassy. He added that staff would not be allowed to leave the building \u201cuntil we are satisfied of their numbers and where they are\u201d. In the past three days, North Korea and Malaysia have declared each other\u2019s ambassadors as \u201cpersona non grata\u201d, ordering them to leave the country. North Korea\u2019s ambassador, Kang Chol, had attempted to block the investigation and prevent an autopsy on Kim Jong-nam\u2019s body. Lab test results later found Kim was killed with the nerve agent VX, a banned chemical weapon known to be produced in state laboratories. The ban on North Koreans leaving Malaysia will largely affect a community of expatriates known to live in Kuala Lumpur, some of whom run restaurants. There are also North Korean labourers working for Malaysian mining companies. The Malaysia Star newspaper quoted an unnamed Malaysian official as saying diplomatic staff in Pyongyang were safe. \u201cWe have communicated with our staff and are in touch with them. They have been advised to lead their lives normally,\u201d the official said. Two women \u2013 one from Vietnam and another from Indonesia \u2013 are believed by Malaysian police to be the two assailants captured on CCTV cameras grabbing Kim Jong-nam\u2019s face. Both were arrested and have been charged with murder. They face the death sentence if convicted, but police reports suggest they did not mastermind the murder. According to Jakarta\u2019s deputy ambassador to Malaysia, Indonesian national Siti Aisyah was paid $90 (\u00a372) for what she believed was a prank. Pyongyang has not identified the deceased man as Kim Jong-nam and says he died from a heart attack. Malaysian police have called for next of kin to come forward to identify the body and provide DNA samples. Friends of Kim Jong-nam have told the Guardian they believe his family has gone into hiding following the attack. In the first report from North Korea\u2019s KCNA news agency since the attack, the government accused Malaysia of breaking international law by conducting autopsies on a diplomatic passport holder and withholding the body. \u201cThis proves that the Malaysian side is going to politicise the transfer of the body in utter disregard of international law and morality and thus attain a sinister purpose,\u201d it said. Last month, North Korea lashed out at Malaysia, accusing it of having a \u201csinister purpose\u201d and collaborating with South Korea, which has said Pyongyang agents assassinated Kim Jong-nam.

The series stays alive, the Border-Gavaskar trophy is up for grabs. The home side looked baked for all money after Nathan \u2018Nathan\u2019 Lyon eroded them through the first session and took his 8-50. But how quickly things can turn: he got none-for in the second innings, and made two runs in two hits with the bat. </p> <p>Australia should really have found their way to a win with a first innings lead of 87 runs on a very difficult pitch. But Rahane and Pujara took the game away with their 118-run stand, the only century partnership of the match, and KL Rahul was equally important with his scores of 90 and 51.</p> <p>All of that meant that India was able to set Australia a target of 188, and on this wicket against this bowling it proved too much. Ashwin got the spoils with his 6-41, but Umesh Yadav was just as important through the middle to get Smith and Shaun Marsh, Ishant kicked things off by bagging Renshaw, and Jadeja provided threat and control. <br /></p> <p>No one could offer much resistance in the Australian camp: Smith top-scored in the second innings with 28, Handscomb made 24 and was only out slogging for runs when hope was all but gone, but the rest couldn\u2019t hack it. Seven single-figure scores out of 11, and a final collapse of 6 for 11. That after ending their first innings with 4 for 7, though there were some good performances there with Shaun Marsh\u2019s 66, Renshaw\u2019s 60 and Wade\u2019s 40. <br /></p> <p>A bowler has taken six or more wickets in six of the eight innings of this series, and this is apparently the first Test match in which four different bowlers have done so. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/07/australia-put-in-a-spin-as-india-complete-remarkable-comeback-in-second-test\">Australia put in a spin as India complete remarkable comeback in second Test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So we go on to Ranchi - Thursday week, to see who can go ahead in this cracker of a series.

He\u2019s quite lucky it doesn\u2019t slip through to Matthew Wade behind the stumps. There is a nice bit of rough for Lyon to bowl into here, and that is the secondary reason the batsmen are getting forward at every opportunity; they need to negate the prospect of the ball shooting low or doing something completely unpredictable.

The series stays alive, the Border-Gavaskar trophy is up for grabs. The home side looked baked for all money after Nathan \u2018Nathan\u2019 Lyon eroded them through the first session and took his 8-50. But how quickly things can turn: he got none-for in the second innings, and made two runs in two hits with the bat. Australia should really have found their way to a win with a first innings lead of 87 runs on a very difficult pitch. But Rahane and Pujara took the game away with their 118-run stand, the only century partnership of the match, and KL Rahul was equally important with his scores of 90 and 51. All of that meant that India was able to set Australia a target of 188, and on this wicket against this bowling it proved too much. Ashwin got the spoils with his 6-41, but Umesh Yadav was just as important through the middle to get Smith and Shaun Marsh, Ishant kicked things off by bagging Renshaw, and Jadeja provided threat and control. No one could offer much resistance in the Australian camp: Smith top-scored in the second innings with 28, Handscomb made 24 and was only out slogging for runs when hope was all but gone, but the rest couldn\u2019t hack it. Seven single-figure scores out of 11, and a final collapse of 6 for 11. That after ending their first innings with 4 for 7, though there were some good performances there with Shaun Marsh\u2019s 66, Renshaw\u2019s 60 and Wade\u2019s 40. A bowler has taken six or more wickets in six of the eight innings of this series, and this is apparently the first Test match in which four different bowlers have done so. So we go on to Ranchi - Thursday week, to see who can go ahead in this cracker of a series. Don\u2019t miss an over of it. We won\u2019t. Geoff Lemon out, see you next time. Edged a couple of runs, Lyon, then tries to drive the flighted ball and Ashwin finishes the game himself with his sixth wicket. Takes the simple return catch and India\u2019s players descend into a huddle of yelling faces and pumping fists. With 78 to get, Handscomb decides he needs to get some of them quickly, and tries for a big slog-sweep. The bat ends up almost vertical, the ball goes up the chimney, and Saha trots a couple of paces back behind the stumps to be there for the drop. 35th over: Australia 110-8 (Handscomb 24, Lyon 0) Lyon tries to get himself out by slogging to cover, but fails. Survives four balls of the Jadeja over. somehow. India on the verge now! This pitch has gone from difficult to unplayable, at least as far as some deliveries were concerned. Left-arm around to the right-hander, the ball hits a flat spot, and commando-rolls into middle stump in a manner untouchable by any bat made by man. 34th over: Australia 110-7 (Handscomb 24, O\u2019Keefe 2) Handscomb a defensive masterclass against Ashwin. Watches the turn, waits back, sharp reflexes. Blots out a maiden. 33rd over: Australia 110-7 (Handscomb 24, O\u2019Keefe 2) Yadav bowls straight, attacking the stumps. Handscomb is good enough to work a couple of singles through square leg, while O\u2019Keefe is hit on the body and gets a leg bye. Yadav couldn\u2019t resist the short ball to a tailender. 32nd over: Australia 107-7 (Handscomb 22, O\u2019Keefe 2) Alarm, alarm, alarm. O\u2019Keefe edges a single. Handscomb flicks a more confident one. Then O\u2019Keefe plays a similar shot, but squarer, and there\u2019s hesitation with the calling. O\u2019Keefe would have been run out at the non-striker\u2019s end had the throw hit. It doesn\u2019t. They get a valuable run, just before Handscomb is beaten on the outside edge by an absolute snorter that spits on straight. Ashwin battled in the first innings without huge reward, but he\u2019s putting on a display here. Handscomb isn\u2019t fussed, coming outside his off stump to nudge another run square on the leg side. 31st over: Australia 103-7 (Handscomb 20, O\u2019Keefe 0) Handscomb isn\u2019t quite sure what to do here. How to approach this? He\u2019s doing it amturely, just trying to calm things down, get settled, instil some confidence in his batting partner. He defends the entire Umesh Yadav over, and when the last ball rears up and hits him high in the ribs under his front arm, he cracks a broad grin and laughs at the bowler. Loving the contest. This is a great tell about a player. 30th over: Australia 103-7 (Handscomb 20, O\u2019Keefe 0) O\u2019Keefe can also defend - remember he was part of Australia sitting on 8-161 for a session against Sri Lanka in Pallekele. He defends Ashwin\u2019s last two balls with positive footwork. I typed all that for nothing. Starc defends a few balls but looks uncomfrtable against Ashwin\u2019s bounce. Then one from the off spinner comes in from around the wicket, holds its line, bounces high, zips past the inside edge of the defensive stroke, hits Starc in the armpit, and knocks down the off bail. 29th over: Australia 103-6 (Handscomb 20, Starc 1) Mitchell Starc has 117 runs so far in the series, in his three innings. That makes him fifth on the runs list, behind only Rahul, Smith, Renshaw and Pujara. If he gets another decent knock here, he could top the list for runs by an Australian No8 or below in a series against India. More importantly, if he gets another decent knock here, Australia wins a Test and retains a trophy. Umesh bowls short, Handscomb stylishly cuts a run, then Starc opens his innings by nudging another into the leg side. 28th over: Australia 101-6 (P Handscomb 19, Starc 0) Last ball of Ahswin\u2019s over, as he took the wicket before tea, and Starc defends it. Send me a tweet, send me an email, do. I\u2019ll try to read them between my interlaced fingers. Wellity wellity well. Get your lunch containers ready indeed, lambies and gooseberries. Inhale, exhale. Think of the work of Telepopmusik, or The Prodigy: breathe. This is a wonderful Test match. This is the business end of it. Another fast Mitchell Starc innings could turn it over. A couple of quick Ravi wickets, whether (ndra) or (chandran), and it flips the other way. But wait... if something flips in either direction, it lands the same way up. So to go the other way it needs to not flip at all. Oh, I don\u2019t even know anymore. Hello. Geoff here. Almost having a coronary already. Farewell, Russell, goodnight sweet prince. And flights of appeals sing thee to thy rest. With that Wade wicket, Australia now stare into the abyss. At tea they\u2019re 87 runs short of the win and India\u2019s spinners will be bowling at the tail. Can Mitchell Starc and Peter Handscomb pull it off? Find out when Geoff Lemon stops by shortly. I\u2019m off to fold myself into the foetal position, or maybe blow into a paper bag for a while. Blimey. It\u2019s happening! The collapse is on. Now Wade presses forward hard to the final delivery of the Ashwin over and when it bobbles up off his pad, Saha sprints past the vacant short leg region, dives and reels in a superb catch. India are right on top! 27th over: Australia 101-5 (Handscomb 19, Wade 0) Australia had just overcome another symbolic psychological hurdle by moving into triple figures before Marsh perished, but to speak like Matthew Hayden for a moment, this has really put the cat amongst the pigeons, cats, mice, plus both sleeping and top dogs. Matthew Wade is at the crease now and Jadeja paired with Ashwin. Buckle in. Mitch Marsh goes! Oh dear, that is unfortunate. He was back and across to the returning Ashwin and feathers an edge into his leg before short leg swoops on it. He was looking very solid until then, but now he\u2019s on his way The person I envy: Geoff Lemon, who will take you through the evening session. We can\u2019t be far off the tea break now. 87 to win for Australia 25th over: Australia 98-4 (Handscomb 16, M Marsh 13) Ishant Sharma is back to replace Umesh, and I like this a lot. He really set the wheels in motion with his fiery spell earlier, but right as I type that Handscomb lathers him through cover for a boundary to reduce the target to two figures. He\u2019s also nudging the singles when they\u2019re on offer. Equally as good is a four Mitch Marsh punches through mid-on, with a perfectly straight bat. That means Australia have reached the half-way point in this chase, and it gets even better when Marsh angles another boundary through the cordon. Super shot. Phil Withall, meanwhile, is the Douglas Jardine of the OBO \u2013 a man fond of skullduggery, and around whom you would not leave your pint unattended. \u201cMay I suggest a simple way round the embarrassment Smith just endured?\u201d he writes. \u201cSimply get a wrist worn device, looking like a popular fitness tracking product and have a member of the coaching staff send a vibration through it when an appeal is advisable. Not within the spirit of the game but very modern. It may catch on, I\u2019d better patent it.\u201d Australia need 90 runs to win. 24th over: Australia 85-4 (Handscomb 11, M Marsh 5) Ravindra Jadeja has 0-3 from six overs at this point, and I reckon Kohli should keep him on a while longer while he\u2019s applying such suffocating pressure. The temptation, of course, will be to bring back Ashwin, who bowls a higher number of wicket balls. 23rd over: Australia 84-4 (Handscomb 10, M Marsh 5) Yadav gets another over and why the hell not, because he\u2019s heauled his side back into the contest and every time you think his threat is disspipating he takes a wicket. Having said that, Peter Handscomb has just deposited him to the fence at deep point with a quite magnificent square drive and Mitch Marsh drives confidently to get four too. With six wickets in hand, Australia need 104 runs to win. 22nd over: Australia 75-4 (Handscomb 5, M Marsh 1) Maiden from Jadeja. He\u2019s absolutely bloody loving this. So am I. Who wouldn\u2019t? Height was the issue in the end. It was clipping the top of off stump, but it went back to the umpire\u2019s call. They\u2019re not dead keen on it, and it wasn\u2019t given, but Jadeja is being Jadeja so it\u2019s reviewed. Brilliant. 21st over: Australia 75-4 (Handscomb 5, M Marsh 1) Holy moly there will be some stink about this Smith thing. Yadav has finished another superb over now, but replays show that Kohli was enraged by Smith\u2019s attempt to seek assistance from the stands. We\u2019ve barely had time to notice that Mitch Marsh is at the crease and off the mark. Gird up your loins, Australia. This could get very ugly. Kohli is winding his arms around and whipping the crowd into a frenzy. It\u2019s all gone a bit UFC. I think I need a double shot of something luridly coloured and petrol-tasting. Chaos in Bangalore! Steve Smith had been trapped dead in front by Yadav but in the process of asking Handscomb whether he should review it, he also seems to be seeking guidance from the change room, which is a no-no. Nigel Llong strides at him like a traffic warden who has noticed someone parked across two spots, and Virat Kohli is also incensed. Either way, the Australian skipper walks off the ground. 20th over: Australia 71-3 (Smith 28, P Handscomb 2) I\u2019ve just realised how this pans out, dear readers: Ravindra Jadeja takes 7-20 and Mitchell Marsh gets out without playing a shot, having frozen on the spot pondering an unintelligible passage of Matthew Hayden\u2019s commentary. Just a maiden for Jadeja here. He\u2019ll swing the wrecking ball through any minute, I\u2019m sure. 19th over: Australia 71-3 (Smith 28, Handscomb 2) The other person who\u2019d better get Australia home in this game is Steve Smith; it did indeed seem to be the Australian captain who talked Shaun Marsh out of reviewing that dismissal. The problem with that is that Smith was practically standing at mid-off as the ball struck his partner, and the bowler was coming around the wicket. Smith was about the least qualified person in the ground to make a call on that one. In further bad news for Australia, Handscomb now cops one in the bread basket from Umesh. By his reaction it didn\u2019t tickle. \u201cI have no fingernails left,\u201d says reader James Lane. \u201cIs it too early to start drinking Indian rum?\u201d Not at all. 18th over: Australia 71-3 (Smith 28, Handscomb 2) I wouldn\u2019t say this will be the making of Peter Handscomb, because he\u2019ll certainly cut the mustard regardless, but what wonders it might do for his confidence if he can channel his powers of playing spin here and get Australia home. He\u2019s been solid enough in this series without going on with it. Here he faces Ravi Jadeja, who is wearing sunglasses from the props department of Point Break. 17th over: Australia 70-3 (Smith 28, Handscomb 1) The pressure of this contest is almost unbearable now, not that you would know it from the way Steve Smith shuffles across in front of his stumps to Yadav\u2019s shooters. He gets an underside edge on one here, which is lucky because he would have been LBW otherwise. Some are coming through at little more than ankle height, others popping up. Australia need 118 to win this Test. What else would you rather be doing? 16th over: Australia 68-3 (Smith 27, Handscomb 0) Jadeja is back into the attack now to replace Ashwin but I\u2019ll be honest, all the drama in this over has been focused on replays of Marsh\u2019s dismissal. If they\u2019d reviewed it he would have survived! Perhaps they were fooled by how much it jagged in off the pitch, but there was daylight between the ball and off stump when it was put through ball-tracker. Deary me. 15th over: Australia 67-3 (Smith 26, Handscomb 0) He was taken off so Jadeja could send down a speculative over of spin, but Umesh Yadav has come up trumps in his second over. Oh my word! Shaun Marsh has left and in-ducker from the returning Umesh Yadav and been trapped in front. The umpire\u2019s finger goes straight up and after a moment of consultation with his skipper he makes the long walk back to the pavilion. Australia are in trouble here. Worse: replays reveal it was both hitting him outside the line of off stump and also just missing the stumps by a matter of inches. Good grief. 14th over: Australia 65-2 (Smith 25, S Marsh 8) Ouch. Ashwin drops short and wide, and Smith doesn\u2019t miss the opportunity to cash in by cutting it to the ropes. Marsh is content to push singles, and it\u2019s sound judgement early in his innings. As they stop for drinks, Australia have eight wickets in hand and require a further 123 runs to clinch a memorable victory. 13th over: Australia 59-2 (Smith 20, S Marsh 7) Virat Kohli saw enough of Umesh Yadav in that one over, and I don\u2019t entirely blame him. There are not many runs to play with, so Ravindra Jadeja appears and produces a maiden first up. Funny that. 12th over: Australia 59-2 (Smith 20, S Marsh 7) \u201cNine an over for 15 overs would be nice,\u201d says Matthew Hayden, outright barracking for a minute. Sunil Gavaskar finally gets his revenge, pointing out that such an equation would still leave the tourists 15 runs short. Sunnyboy indeed. Back in the middle, Marsh faces up to the marauding Ashwin and makes an absolute mockery of the game situation, caressing a cover drive to the fence like he\u2019s playing in the backyard. He cops a lot of stick, Marsh, but his sheer talent is surely unquestioned. Australia need 129 to win from here. 11th over: Australia 53-2 (Smith 19, S Marsh 2) Umesh is indeed the man who comes into the attack, and has no luck to start with as a thick outside edge from Steve Smith passes through the left hand of a diving Virat Kohli at seconds slip. What would have been good: a first slip. What else would be good: if this is all over today so our nerves aren\u2019t shredded any further. Nine off the over for Australia. 10th over: Australia 44-2 (Smith 11, S Marsh 1) Australia, meet your saviour: erm, Shaun Marsh. Let\u2019s be honest, he played a gem of an innings to get 66 earlier in this game, but there is also the fact he had more lives than every single cat to have appeared in a Matthew Hayden idiom. And so it begins: Warner is gone! He was attempting to sweep Ashwin there, and it got a little out of reach. Umpire Richard Illingworth had no hestitation and with ball-tracker showing it would have hit off stump, the third umpire stays with the original call. Warner falls one short of the blazing 18 I predicted of him, but confirms every other suspicion I had. This match is on a knife edge. Warner does not look confident here, which is a very bad sign for Australia. Smith appeared to overrule, probably figuring his partner is a man who can win this game in 45 minutes of decent batting. We shall soon see. 9th over: Australia 42-1 (Warner 17, Smith 10) Kohli does indeed grant Ishant one more over, but he\u2019s a diminished force as it wears on. It\u2019s very hard yakka to bowl long spells in this heat. Australia might have seen off the residual danger, though Yadav has a knack for taking early wickets. Whether he gets a go before or after first-innings spin hero Ravindra Jadeja is the question from here. 8th over: Australia 40-1 (Warner 16, Smith 9) Bang! Warner hits a big six off Ashwin, nailing it over long on for a maximum. Risky, but it\u2019s paid off. One thing I do love about Matthew Hayden is the way he refers to Sunil Gavaskar, scorer of 10,000 Test runs, as \u201cSunnyboy\u201d. If you don\u2019t speak Australian, that is a sugary ice block in a cardboard box. He also says this is a game of cat and mouse where there can be only one top tog. He\u2019s wandered off to the zoo again. 7th over: Australia 31-1 (Warner 10, Smith 7) Ishant keeps charging in with the firm belief that he\u2019s the second coming of Dennis Lillee, which is an admirable character trait in conditions like the ones he\u2019s normally bowling in. Warner runs a single through gully and gets off strike again, leaving his skipper to feel his way in a little further. Will Ishant get another over? I\u2019d be tempted to allow him one more, but Umesh Yadav is probably warming up right now. With the cameras panning to the families of the Australian players, Brett Lee diffuses the tension of the contest with some patented inanity, explaining what the term \u201cWAG\u201d stands for, before catching himself: \u201cIt\u2019s not a really good term I guess, but that\u2019s what they call them.\u201d Thanks Bing. 6th over: Australia 29-1 (Warner 9, Smith 6) Cometh the hour, cometh the David Warner reverse sweep. What a madman. Anybody else would go into their shell right now, but he\u2019s dancing about the crease doing a one-man recreation of Torvill and Dean\u2019s bolero. They didn\u2019t even have a Gray-Nicolls Kaboom to whack stuff with either, the jokers. A single gets him off strike, which is for the best on a number of levels; he can\u2019t self-immolate when he\u2019s down the other end, and Smith batters Ashwin for four through mid-wicket and then two through cover. Is anyone else\u2019s face really hot? This game is giving me a fever. 5th over: Australia 22-1 (Warner 8, Smith 0) Steve Smith is at the crease now, and he\u2019s the subject of a very optimistic LBW shout from Ishant first up. That one hit the Australian skipper closer to his hip than his knee. His troubles aren\u2019t over though; Ishant thunders one down and hits one of those crater-like cracks in the pitch, so the ball snakes away from Smith\u2019s outside edge and almost ends him. It ends up a wicket-maiden for Ishant, who bowls like a demon throughout. Ishant strikes! There was a prolonged delay as technicians tried to get Spidercam away from Matt Renshaw, and then something even nastier approached him: Ishant Sharma with an off-cutter. The left-hander fences unconvincingly and feathers an edge through to the keeper Saha. India have the breakthrough! 4th over: Australia 22-0 (Warner 8, Renshaw 5) Calm down, Davey. Warner goes after Ashwin now, failing to heed the lesson learned by Renshaw two overs ago and attempting to flog it to cow corner against the spin. Not wise. Next ball Ashwin sends a textbook off-break fizzing past his outside edge. Superb bowling. Warner looks a rube in the face of such brilliance. The spinner seems to be bowling a little flatter here, and he looks like getting Warner with nearly every ball of the over before jagging another monster turner past the outside edge and beyond the grasp of Saha for four byes. Ashwin is pitching it well outside leg stump to the left-hander and turning it at right angles. Testing times ahead for both batsmen. 3rd over: Australia 18-0 (Warner 8, Renshaw 5) Ishant comes around the wicket now when he\u2019s bowling to Warner, and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s by his own free will because a conversation with Kohli preceded the new approach. Warner still profits, working two through mid wicket before gently pushing one down to long on for three. Of note: this might be the last time he bats with that humongous Gray Nicolls \u2018Kaboom\u2019 bat, because it\u2019s about to be banned. Ishant, meanwhile, has a spirited LBW shout against Renshaw but I think he knows it hit the pad outside the line of off stump, so there is no review. Australia now need 170 to win. 2nd over: Australia 13-0 (Warner 3, Renshaw 5) Four more valuable runs to Australia here as Ravi Ashwin is favoured to open the bowling with some spin, and Warner pads him to the fence at fine leg. Australia will take them any way they can get them today. Warner gets a quick single too, and has started with typically manic intent. Renshaw gets a leading edge attempting to hit against the spin through mid-wicket, but picks up a single, then there is another to Warner. With minimal fuss, Australia are 13 from two overs. 1st over: Australia 6-0 (Warner 1, Renshaw 5) Aaaaand we\u2019re back in Bangalore, with Ishant Sharma bounding in to David Warner. \u201cI\u2019ve just found out during the break that 17 of his 18 hundreds have come in either Australia or South Africa,\u201d says Michael Clarke. He\u2019s talking about Warner, of course, but the note of incredulity is what\u2019s so brilliant about the statement. He genuinely can\u2019t believe it. Warner is off the mark with a single, but I\u2019ll be honest: I have a very bad feeling about this chase as far as Australia are concerned. It has a very \u2018Warner out for a blazing 18\u2019 feel about it. We shall see. Matt Renshaw opens the face of the bat to Ishant but doesn\u2019t control a nick through the cordon region. He\u2019s lucky that it doesn\u2019t carry and doubly so that it races away for four runs. Good start for Australia. Damien Martyn might be the only person not watching this game of cricket Remember when it was revealed that Martyn was among the 47 people followed by Donald Trump? Good times. So we can breathe. India started the day at 214-4, and Pujara looked perfectly comfortable in adding 24 more runs before Rahane was trapped in front by Starc, triggering a monumental collapse. India lost 5-20 from 19 balls at one stage, and 6-36 all up to squander a chance to put this game beyond doubt. Now? Australia have a sniff. Even a chase as small as this will be very tough work, and they\u2019ll have the 40-minute lunch break to think about it. WICKET! Ishant c S Marsh b O\u2019Keefe - 6 Ishant goes, holing out to Marsh at cover after a determined little knock. And with that wicket, Australia will chase 188 for the win. 97th over: India 274-9 (Saha 20, Ishant 6) - India lead by 187 Saha is a brick wall at the moment, and rather showing up some of his team-mates. He\u2019s batting a good half-metre out of his crease to Hazlewood and that is no mean feat. Right as I say that he offers a chance but Warner\u2019s dive is unsuccessful at mid-off. But there is a throw at the stumps and it hits. It\u2019s reviewed, but Ishant survives. 96th over: India 274-9 (Saha 20, Ishant 6) - India lead by 187 Says Matthew Hayden as Steve O\u2019Keefe replaces Nathan Lyon and his blistered finger: \u201cHe may as well go home because that\u2019s not going anywhere, that injury... It\u2019s time to move on I think.\u201d Blimey. I\u2019d hate to be a patient of Dr Hayden. \u2018Look, I\u2019ve seen a bit of a graze on your knee there...Sorry, but there is nothing we can do. You might be a goner within days. Take care of your financial affairs and say your goodbyes.\u2019 95th over: India 273-9 (Saha 19, Ishant 6) - India lead by 186 Josh Hazlewood\u2019s analysis was 6-66 at the start of this over, and it\u2019s been ominous stuff for India. He took three of them yesterday, and has ripped the heart out of India\u2019s second innings with a startling spell today. But...this is turning into a pesky partnership. It\u2019s worth 15 very handy runs now. Oof, a fair portion of the ball was clipping the leg stump but not enough to reverse Llong\u2019s call. He also might not have. Nigel Llong doesn\u2019t like it, and he\u2019s usually pretty sharp. 94th over: India 272-9 (Saha 18, Ishant 6) - India lead by 185 Nathan Lyon has a blister on his finger, apparently. His spinning finger. He hasn\u2019t been playing the guitar at the team hotel or anything. Right now it appears to be troubling him, and that means he\u2019s not troubling the batsmen. Ishant, meanwhile, is looking very solid. \u201cHe\u2019s showing a lot more responsibility than the batsmen who preceded him,\u201d notes Sunny Gavaskar, adopting the tone of a peeved headmaster. He\u2019s not angry, he\u2019s just disappointed. 93rd over: India 269-9 (Saha 16, Ishant 5) - India lead by 182 Hmm, with Hazlewood reappearing now in a change of ends, Saha goes back to refusing singles. From the fourth delivery of the over Saha decides to finally take one, and Ishant repays his faith by surviving the final two balls of the over. Things have calmed a little now after the stump-flying mayhem of the 30 minutes prior to this partnership. 92nd over: India 268-9 (Saha 15, Ishant 5) - India lead by 181 Bang! Ishant responds to the arrival of Lyon by dropping to one knee and proposing a sweep. It works, and the ball tumbles away to the fence. Then he gets off strike, and looks like a proper batsman all of sudden. He wants the strike now, and Saha allows it. Lyon has an LBW shout near the end of the over but decides against a review; it clearly hit the pad well outside the line of off stump. A significant understatement: another 20 runs would be very handy for India. 91st over: India 262-9 (Saha 14, Ishant 0) - India lead by 175 Of interest as Mitchell Starc stars the 91st over is that lunch is due in thirty-five minutes, and Wriddhiman Saha continues to refuse singles early in the over. He saw enough from Ishant in the last over to know he\u2019s a liability. Starc bounds around the wicket and delivers from very wide on the crease, but the angle isn\u2019t troubling Saha too badly. The penultimate delivery brings a stifled LBW shout, but only Steve Smith and the bowler are interested. Eventually Saha clubs an inside-out drive to the fence at long-off, and Smith shakes his head as though he\u2019s never been so disgusted in his life. Nathan Lyon will come back to bowl the next over. 90th over: India 258-9 (Saha 10, Ishant 0) - India lead by 171 A Josh Hazlewood over without a wicket counts as a win for India at the moment, though again it\u2019s a maiden, so they\u2019re only delaying the inevitable. Ishant faces this one, and he\u2019s hopping around like a cat on a hot tin roof to counter the Australian\u2019s bouncers. A very tall cat. Hazlewood engages in some lovely pantomime at the end of the over, shaking his head and ruing his inefficiency for only bowling six dot balls. 89th over: India 258-9 (Saha 10, Ishant 0) - India lead by 171 Poor Mitchell Starc has produced a beautiful spell today but doesn\u2019t have the wickets to show for it. Saha takes the responsibility of handling him in this over, and as that happens I\u2019m just seeing a few more replays of Hazlewood\u2019s Ambrose-to-Blewett style dismissal of Ravi Ashwin. It shot through at ankle height before breaking the stump at its base. Brilliant. Not so much for Ashwin, I guess. Here is the Ambrose one, for the five people in the world who haven\u2019t seen it yet: 88th over: India 258-9 (Saha 10, Ishant 0) - India lead by 171 India have just lost 5-20 in 19 deliveries of brainless batting, and Australia will be daring to believe they\u2019ll win this Test match and with it the Border-Gavaskar trophy. Quite remarkable, really. Brian Withington has a question: \u201cHeard any more about the art of captaincy from Sankaran Krishna (over 82) I wonder?\u201d Ouch. Holy smokes, that is a terrible shot from Yadav! Hazlewood had considered a review when he thought he might have trapped the tailender in front, but didn\u2019t. It mattered not a ball later when Yadav lost his mind and slogged one straight to Warner at wide mid off. Virat Kohli will have steam coming out his ears. Dreadful, but what a session for Australia and Hazlewood. He has six wickets! 87th over: India 258-8 (Saha 10, Yadav 1) Umesh Yadav reaches the crease now, though I can imagine he faced a scramble not to be timed out. India have lost four wickets for eight runs for him to be required. Not long ago they lead by 150 with six wickets in hand. Now Australia can knock them off with another two poles. Saha senses the urgent need for more runs, and clubs a rather artless boundary through mid-on from the bowling of Starc. Saha is also turning down runs so as to keep Umesh off strike, which is probably wise. Thomas Walker writes in from an unlikely location to be enjoying an Indian collapse: \u201cThanks for the awesome OBO coverage, I\u2019m following the action from my bed in Chicago. Trying to recover from a big weekend in Vegas but this Australian fightback is too thrilling, Starc and Hazlewood have swung it back our way. Even my (American) girlfriend can\u2019t sleep, probably because I\u2019m screaming at every wicket / boundary (which seems to be every ball at the moment).\u201d The last 20 minutes has felt a lot like a night out in Las Vegas, to be honest. RIght on cue, Wriddhiman Saha clubs Starc to long-off and gets his side a very handy six runs. India lead by 171 runs. Now Ashwin goes in a moment of madness! This is a bit absurd now. Ashwin was the new man at the crease for India, and though he\u2019d immediately unleashed a beautiful square drive through the vacant point region to pick up four, Hazlewood attacks his stumps with the next ball and it keeps low to splatter them. Hazlewood has five wickets! Even better, as he was running in to bowl the delivery in question, having already taken a wicket in the over, Matthew Hayden said the following: \u201cJosh Hazlewood\u2019s job here is containment.\u201d Now Pujara goes! Hooley dooley this game is going mad. He\u2019d just turned a boundary down to fine leg to move into the 90s, but then, having never been dismissed so close to a hundred, he wafts at a short one outside off and guides a catch to Mitchell Marsh at gully. India are collapsing exactly as Australia did in their first innings. Madness. 85th over: India 238-6 (Pujara 88, Saha 0) What an over from Starc. Two wickets and two runs were the result, and the course of the game has altered just a little. India lead by 151 but Australia will fancy keeping their target under 200. But only just. Holy moly what a ball. It was full and fast and swinging in, and the Indian keeper gets an inside edge into his pad. Time for the dark underpants, I would think. Starc strikes again! This time he castles the new man Karun Nair, who made 303* in his last Test but gets an in-swinging snorter first up here \u2013 castled for a golden duck. Starc is producing a gem of a spell. Starc gets the breakthrough! It was a superb knock by Rahane, but the new ball has done the trick for Australia. Starc was full, straight, and swinging it in just slightly, and the batsman got only a small stride in before it cannoned into his front pad. It\u2019s hit him dead in front. Gorn! It looks pretty good to me. 84th over: India 235-4 (Pujara 88, Rahane 51) Big swing, no ding. Pujara unfurls a very optimistic cover drive when Hazlewood pushes one well wide of off stump, but it\u2019s a fresh-air shot for the batsman. Reader Raymond Reardon has sent me an email about the churlishness of Australians, but it is too churlish to be approved by our lawyers. I\u2019ll have to file it with all the ones I received after writing about Todd Carney\u2019s \u201cbubbling\u201d affair. Maiden for Hazlewood. Good areas and all that. 83rd over: India 235-4 (Pujara 88, Rahane 51) Starc bounds in and unleashes a Harmisonesque sideways wide, which almost takes out Steve Smith at first slip. \u201cI\u2019d like to see some toes and nose stuff,\u201d says Matthew Hayden. Not at your team-mates though, surely. Starc is bowling very quick indeed; 150kmph first up, then 143, 149, 151, 148 and 152. Steve O\u2019Keefe has a ping at the stumps when Pujara sprints through for a quick single to finish the over, and it was a fiery one from Starc. 82nd over: India 232-4 (Pujara 87, Rahane 51) No surprises now as Josh Hazlewood pairs with Starc, ambling in on the hunt for more wickets to go with the three beauties he took yesterday. As that happens, reader Sankaran Krishna has some thoughts on Steve Smith\u2019s captaincy, which I will post in the interests of balance: \u201cLyon and O\u2019Keefe were causing the batsmen all sorts of problems. But the minute the second new ball became available Smith didnt hesitate at all \u2013 took it. Gotta love how uncomplicated the Aussies keep the game.\u201d Shots fired! The fourth delivery of the Hazlewood over is the most interesting, though not so much as to call the umpires into action. Pujara lunges forward with his front pad well outside the line to smother the ball, and the bowlers thinks it\u2019s worth a shout. It\u2019s not. Maiden. 81st over: India 232-4 (Pujara 87, Rahane 51) In fact Steve Smith does take the first opportunity to unleash Mitchell Starc with the second new ball, and in these sorts of situations it normally takes the giant speedster an over or so to warm up. Right on cue, a loosener is lathered through cover by Rahane and with that he\u2019s reached 50 from 128 deliveries of patient, game-turning batting. Brian Withington drops by with an email. \u201cI know he has lived dangerously but are we witnessing a (not so) minor classic innings from \u201cHoudini\u201d Pujara?\u201d he asks. \u201cWho but the most churlish (and hence vanishingly rare) Aussie could begrudge him at least a hundred?\u201d Brian, I really think you\u2019re underestimating the Australian capacity for churlishness. With that Pujara turns a couple to leg and Rahane survives being bowled by a whisker. The spawny gits. India lead by 145. 80th over: India 224-4 (Pujara 84, Rahane 46) Rahane skips down the track again and batters Lyon out to long-on, but there\u2019s a man posted out on that boundary so it\u2019s a lot of energy expended for a single. Lyon\u2019s approach to Pujara is from a regulation angle over the wicket, and he might soon be tempted to use the bowling crease a little more and come wider. Pujara\u2019s defences, which looked leaky in the early stages of his innings, are suddenly watertight. 79th over: India 223-4 (Pujara 84, Rahane 45) The new ball is due soon, but might not be taken the way Lyon is bowling. Owing to that, both batsmen are doing their best to pick up singles from O\u2019Keefe. There\u2019s one each for them in this over. Tension building. 78th over: India 221-4 (Pujara 83, Rahane 44) Lyon continues to Rahane, and you get the sense he\u2019s getting close to a wicket here. He tosses one up to tempt Rahane forward and the batsmen nearly drowns in honey, flapping away at it but fluffing an attempt to put it back in row Z. He\u2019s quite lucky it doesn\u2019t slip through to Matthew Wade behind the stumps. There is a nice bit of rough for Lyon to bowl into here, and that is the secondary reason the batsmen are getting forward at every opportunity; they need to negate the prospect of the ball shooting low or doing something completely unpredictable. A lot of people whinged about this Test, but you can\u2019t argue with the quality of the cricket it\u2019s produced. Enthralling. 77th over: India 221-4 (Pujara 83, Rahane 44) Twenty minutes ago Sunny Gavaskar was telling us that it was spinning slowly, now Michael Clarke says it\u2019s spinning fast. Either way, batting is a very tricky business with the Australian spinners bowling with accuracy and plenty of pressure from the close-in fieldsmen. A single to Rahane is the only damage in this over, a very good one by Steve O\u2019Keefe. 76th over: India 220-4 (Pujara 83, Rahane 43) The Australians were utterly convinced that was out, but Richard Illingworth has had a bit of a shocker there. It was spinning well past leg stump, though Pujara was well back and pinned to the crease. He survives the rest of the over as Lyon continues to work him over. Pujara survives! It was missing leg and he knew it, the Indian No3. He lives to fight another day but Nathan Lyon is in the mood here. Pujara has reviewed it, and it did spin a mile so I think that\u2019s fair enough. 75th over: India 220-4 (Pujara 83, Rahane 43) As Pujara and Rahane bring up a superb 100-run partnership, the Australians can\u2019t decide betwen SOK-a, SOK-y and SOK-o as Steve O\u2019Keefe\u2019s nickname. More on that as it\u2019s at hand. It clearly bounced. As you were. Nigel Llong gave it out, short leg Peter Handscomb wasn\u2019t sure if it carried, so we\u2019re going upstairs 74th over: India 218-4 (Pujara 82, Rahane 42) Rahane backs away and has a good look around the ground before facing up to Lyon, but I\u2019m not sure an outside edge was his plan first up. Fortunately for him it doesn\u2019t carry to Steve Smith. Lyon has a leg slip, a short leg, but no silly point and no cover, so they\u2019re encouraging Rahane to drive. The cover comes back for Pujara. There is a big shout from Wade for LBW, but Lyon is too honest to go along with it. It struck Pujara\u2019s front pad a decent distance outside the line of off stump. 73rd over: India 215-4 (Pujara 80, Rahane 41) Steve O\u2019Keefe has the ball to start with and that\u2019s because the new one isn\u2019t due for eight overs. Pujara turns him around the corner for a single first up and by the sounds of things, there are thousands of singing kids in the stands. Or just 50 very loud ones. There is not much spin from O\u2019Keefe, though that\u2019s not really his bag. It\u2019s keeping just a touch low, which very much is his bag. A solid start from him, and Nathan Lyon will bowl from the other end. As the players trot out, here\u2019s our first reader email of the day And it\u2019s from OBO chum Robert McLiam Wilson. \u201cConfident prediction has always been nature\u2019s way of telling you that you are an arsebiscuit,\u201d he starts. \u201cAs all those who relaxed about Trump before the election (and who are still similarly relaxing about Marine Le Pen) will testify. Notwithstanding, I\u2019m not sure I have ever seen a game which so so categorically uncallable. Anything could happen. India could get 350. Or not. Lyon could get nine [editor\u2019s note: this would be brilliant, as there are only six left to take]. Or not. It\u2019s richly unpredictable. So, I\u2019m making my call. Something will happen today that produces a wave of disobliging remarks about the umpires and then Jimmy Neesham will tweet something funny about it. There.\u201d Matthew Wade\u2019s keeping ...is bound to be a topic of conversation when this series is done in dusted, perhaps less so if Australia pull off a miracle series win. But this little video highlights a recurring issue in the way Wade rises too far too quickly, falls off balance and has his foot flying off into the air. Don Tallon would be turning in his grave. More on the pitch, whose cracks are really starting to open up Here it is in terms of what the batsmen need to do: \u201cIt really is going to be a test of how quick you make the adjustment \u2013 how quick you get down when the ball keeps low,\u201d says Sunil Gavaskar. He reckons it\u2019s slowed a bit now, so it\u2019s easier to make said adjustments. Good news for Australia? Maybe, but also perhaps for Pujara and Rahane. I refuse to believe it\u2019ll be much fun to bat on by late tonight. The Virat Kohli controversy is still bubbling away Ryan Harris adds to it now by saying that the Indian captain\u2019s decision to wave his bat about as he left the field \u2013 indicating he thought he\u2019d hit the ball before it had struck his pad \u2013 amounts to dissent. Whether it is pursued by the match referee accordingly, we will wait and see. On the topic of the job done by the umpires, Ravi Shastri is a little more sanguine. \u201cI think the TV umpire got it absolutely right,\u201d he says. \u201cThe on-field decision was out, so it stays. There is absolutely no argument about that.\u201d Steve Smith is out in the middle now And he\u2019s got a bat in his hands, eyeing off the pitch and making a mental plan for what\u2019s ahead. His side need to take six wickets first, mind you. Nathan Lyon snared eight in the first innings and hasn\u2019t got one yet in the second. Related to all this: the new ball is due in eight overs, which works reasonably well for Australia. The bowlers will get a feel for things before the call is made and the batsmen may have to reset with its arrival. \u201cIt\u2019s quite challenging when it hits that rough bit,\u201d says Matthew Wade now, talking about keeping up to the stumps to Nathan Lyon. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the one spinner in the game who has got variable bounce,\u201d he says of the man known as Garry. Ravindra Jadeja might disagree with that. Preamble Hello all and welcome to day four of the second Test between Australia and India in Bangalore, in which we\u2019ve seen three of the more compelling days of cricket you could ever hope for. As per the first Test in Pune, India looked down and out heading into day three, but a combination of Ravindra Jadeja\u2019s mercurial bowling, and the contrastingly brilliant batting of Lokesh Rahul, Che Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane has India 126 runs ahead. Today, on a deteriorating pitch, they\u2019ll hope to add another 100 more at the very least. They\u2019ll do that knowing how difficult it will be to counter the likes of Jadeja and Ravi Ashwin, even in pursuit of a modest total. I for one can\u2019t wait, and trust you\u2019re feeling the same. Don\u2019t be shy. I\u2019m only an email or tweet away. Russell will be here shortly. In the meantime, read how Virat Kohli has succeeded in ruffling a few Australian feathers so far this Test series:",

But India found their nose in front at the only time that matters, defying Australia\u2019s attempt to wrap up the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with a 75-run victory at Bangalore, steamrolling Steve Smith\u2019s side for 112 inside 36 overs. </p> <p>The hosts threw away their own advantage on the fourth morning when Australia\u2019s quicks ran rampant with the second new ball, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood combining for 5-20 in the space of 18 electrifying balls. 188 runs stood between Australia and an unbeatable 2-0 series lead with two sessions remaining on the fourth day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/07/virat-kohli-lays-into-steve-smith-and-australia-following-second-test-incident\">Virat Kohli lays into Steve Smith and Australia following second Test incident</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But after lunch India\u2019s bowlers went to work, taking six wickets in the session, including two with the score at 101 on the cusp of tea, before finishing the job in style. Australia\u2019s last four wickets fell in half an hour after the final break, the lower-order collapse reading a disastrous six wickets for just 11 runs.</p> <p>Ravichandran Ashwin was the predictable destroyer, the best spin bowler on the planet finishing with 6-41. It was a clinic of how to bowl in the fourth innings without a mass of runs to defend: all out attack. It is the 25<sup>th</sup> time he has taken a five-wicket bag in Tests.</p> <p>When Steve Smith and David Warner came together after Matt Renshaw was the first to go, edging a delightful Ishant Sharma delivery, Indian skipper Virat Kohli was heard on the effects microphone willing his team: \u201cGet these two and it\u2019s wrapped up!\u201d He wasn\u2019t far from the mark.</p> <p>Warner was first of the leadership pair to depart, electing to review a leg before decision after Ashwin beat his bat when sweeping. The technology sided with umpire Nigel Llong, albeit just, in keeping with tightness that defined this contest from the moment the teams returned on day two.</p> <p>Shaun Marsh suffered the same fate when Umesh Yadav jagged a delivery back towards the left-hander from around the wicket. The West Australian shouldered arms and Llong didn\u2019t hesitate. Knowing a review was already lost through the Warner dismissal, he walked off. On reflection, he should have asked the question \u2013 the ball was missing by a significant margin.</p> <p>There was no consideration for the captain Smith to go upstairs either, the unfortunate recipient of a ball that barely bounced above ankle height, from one of the many cracks that opened over the final 24 hours of the match.

But India found their nose in front at the only time that matters, defying Australia\u2019s attempt to wrap up the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with a 75-run victory at Bangalore, steamrolling Steve Smith\u2019s side for 112 inside 36 overs. The hosts threw away their own advantage on the fourth morning when Australia\u2019s quicks ran rampant with the second new ball, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood combining for 5-20 in the space of 18 electrifying balls. 188 runs stood between Australia and an unbeatable 2-0 series lead with two sessions remaining on the fourth day. But after lunch India\u2019s bowlers went to work, taking six wickets in the session, including two with the score at 101 on the cusp of tea, before finishing the job in style. Australia\u2019s last four wickets fell in half an hour after the final break, the lower-order collapse reading a disastrous six wickets for just 11 runs. Ravichandran Ashwin was the predictable destroyer, the best spin bowler on the planet finishing with 6-41. It was a clinic of how to bowl in the fourth innings without a mass of runs to defend: all out attack. It is the 25th time he has taken a five-wicket bag in Tests. When Steve Smith and David Warner came together after Matt Renshaw was the first to go, edging a delightful Ishant Sharma delivery, Indian skipper Virat Kohli was heard on the effects microphone willing his team: \u201cGet these two and it\u2019s wrapped up!\u201d He wasn\u2019t far from the mark. Warner was first of the leadership pair to depart, electing to review a leg before decision after Ashwin beat his bat when sweeping. The technology sided with umpire Nigel Llong, albeit just, in keeping with tightness that defined this contest from the moment the teams returned on day two. Shaun Marsh suffered the same fate when Umesh Yadav jagged a delivery back towards the left-hander from around the wicket. The West Australian shouldered arms and Llong didn\u2019t hesitate. Knowing a review was already lost through the Warner dismissal, he walked off. On reflection, he should have asked the question \u2013 the ball was missing by a significant margin. There was no consideration for the captain Smith to go upstairs either, the unfortunate recipient of a ball that barely bounced above ankle height, from one of the many cracks that opened over the final 24 hours of the match. The animosity between he and Kohli was significant when Smith appeared to seek guidance from the dressing rooms as to whether he should review. More to come on that, no doubt, from the match referee. A period of productive consolidation played out at the point between Peter Handscomb and Mitchell Marsh, the two combining for 27, taking the runs required down to 87. However, with five minutes remaining before the tea break was scheduled, Ashwin caught Marsh\u2019s glove on the way though to short-leg.

Savvy work from Ravindra Jadeja, racing through a maiden in the space of 90 seconds, ensured that Ashwin would sneak another in before the interval with 30 seconds to spare. He made the most of it, his penultimate ball holding its line to collect Matthew Wade\u2019s inside edge before he scored, wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha completing a fine diving catch racing around from behind the stumps. The rapturous celebrations from Ashwin and his captain as they left the field suggested that they knew that Australia were now as good as done, with only the bowlers left to partner with Handscomb in what would inevitably be the final session of the Test. And they were right. Fewer than eight overs were required for Ashwin and Jadeja to finish the job. The former hit the top of Starc\u2019s off-stump within minutes of the resumption before Steve O\u2019Keefe was also castled when Jadeja slipped a slider underneath his bat.

Both organisations have accused the government of shortsightedness, and said without their services, or any feasible replacement, Indigenous LGBTQI people will be less likely to seek medical care. The Northern Territory Aids and Hepatitis Council\u2019s Aboriginal sexual health program, and the Queensland Aids Council\u2019s 2 Spirits program have run for more than 20 years addressing the disproportionately high rate of sexually transmitted infections among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Both organisations were told last year they should seek alternative funding to continue operating beyond June 2017. In Senate estimates last week, Department of Health officials said they had done a \u201cdesktop review\u201d of programs.

It is Isaiah Firebrace, a former X Factor winner; a fact that ruined one audience member\u2019s hope that \u201cit not be a song contest competition winner\u201d. Crammed into Melbourne\u2019s Paris Cat jazz club, about 100 competition winners, musicians and journalists gathered to hear Humphries make the announcement on Tuesday evening, many waving Australian flags and wearing fairy lights.

Choosing between a power ballad or an upbeat over-the-top sensory overload of key changes and special effects is something countries need to contend with every year. Kyriakos Gold, from Melbourne, reporting for Eurovision portal Oikot Times, said Australians generally developed a sense of national identity by uniting through sport. \u201cBut this puts us on the map uniting us as one using entertainment and song, and unifies us to be part of a competition in the old country but with a new identity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at it in that way it makes absolute sense to have Australia in a traditionally European competition.\u201d Jack Eaton, 24, travelled from Adelaide after winning a ticket to the announcement by entering a costume competition on Facebook.

Sport New cricket laws will be introduced later this year that include limitations on bat size and letting umpires send off players \u2013 just in time for the start of the Ashes series in November. Cycling\u2019s Team Sky have closed ranks and backed Sir Dave Brailsford amid suggestions of growing rider unrest within the ranks. In football, Chelsea restored their 10-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a 2-1 win at West Ham, and the chairman of Kick It Out has criticised the Football Association\u2019s planned reforms, branding them unfair and superficial. Business Business leaders have made a final plea to the chancellor before the Budget announcement, calling on him to reduce the impact of changes to commercial rates that could double the tax bill for some firms. The British Retail Consortium has written to Philip Hammond, saying the high street needs a \u201cfundamental reform\u201d of the tax, while a survey by the British Chambers of Commerce found business rates were the biggest concern for half of small firms.

The Telegraph leads on education and runs a column by Theresa May in which she reveals she is scrapping the ban on grammar schools and will spend \u00a3320m on 140 new free schools in an attempt to end the \u201cbrutal and unacceptable\u201d truth of selection by income. The Mail takes a different tack, with the news that parents, charities and community groups will be given the right to set up grammar schools. The Guardian also reports on the new generation of grammar schools, with teachers\u2019 groups asking why the money isn\u2019t going into existing state schools. At the other end of the print media spectrum, The Sun and Daily Mirror both claim exclusives on the same subject: Paul Burrell \u2013 Princess Diana\u2019s former butler \u2013 announcing that he is gay and is marrying his partner.

According to reports in the Chinese media, urban planners in Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, have drawn up proposals to pipe water into the chronically parched region from Russia\u2019s Lake Baikal, the deepest freshwater lake on earth. Li Luoli, an academic who is one of the plan\u2019s cheerleaders, claimed the mega-project - roughly the equivalent of pumping water from Lake Como to London - was both theoretically feasible and \u201ccertainly beneficial\u201d to China. \u201cOnce the technical issues are resolved, diplomats should sit down and talk to each other about how each party would benefit from such international cooperation,\u201d said Li, the vice president of the China Society of Economic Reform, a state-run think tank. In a report this week the state-run Global Times said the pipeline would quench the \u201cdesperate thirst\u201d of a province that saw just 380mm of rain last year. It would begin at the southwestern tip of the 600km-long Russian lake and run about 1,000km, across Mongolia, to Gansu\u2019s capital through the Hexi corridor, a desert region near the westernmost tip of the Great Wall of China. The project would boost both Gansu\u2019s \u201cecological environment\u201d and its economy which the newspaper said had been severely hampered by the lack of water. The drastic plan underscores the severity of the water crisis facing Beijing. China has 20% of the world\u2019s population but just 7% of its fresh water with the north, in particular, facing a calamitous shortage thanks to urbanisation, over-use, wastage and pollution. In 2005 China\u2019s former minister of water resources, Wang Shucheng, warned that by 2020 many northern cities, including the capital, might run out of water. Plans to pipe in Siberian water, which are likely to alarm conservationists, are not the first of their kind. Last year Russia\u2019s agriculture minister, Alexander Tkachev, suggested pumping water across Kazakhstan to Xinjiang, another dry northwestern region, but only \u201cunder the condition of full compliance with the interests of Russia, including environmental\u201d.

In 2014 it inaugurated one of the biggest engineering feats in history, the \u00a348bn South-North Water Diversion, a huge web of canals and reservoirs built to shift trillions of gallons of water each year from southern China to its water-deprived north. The project, first conceived by Mao but only approved in 2002, was plagued by criticism of its massive price-tag and impact on nature and people, hundreds of thousands of whom were forced from their homes as a result.

The royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse examined immigration detention, including offshore detention, in a limited fashion on Monday. It spent several hours hearing from an independent expert who investigated child protection in immigration detention, Margaret Allison, and two senior departmental figures, secretary Michael Pezzullo, and first assistant secretary Cheryl-Anne Moy. The royal commission has not spoken with survivors or other children, and Monday\u2019s hearing focused largely on the work of the government-commissioned child protection panel, which produced the Making Children Safer report last year. The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Group said it feared the commission was taking a two-tier approach to child abuse, which denied a voice to asylum seekers. The group\u2019s statement was supported by eminent child psychiatrist, Michael Dudley, who said it was essential that the rights of all children were recognised, and that they were assured protection and freedom from harm. \u201cIn no way, should immigration institutions be less responsible for child protection than other mandated institutions,\u201d Dudley said. A spokeswoman for the royal commission said its final report would include a \u201ccomprehensive discussion\u201d of its work on immigration detention. The royal commission has ordered the department and its contractors to produce documents on allegations of child sexual abuse in immigration detention. It has also considered previous reports and inquiries into the protection of children in immigration detention. \u201cThe final report of the royal commission will include a comprehensive discussion of the work that the royal commission has completed in this area,\u201d the spokeswoman said. The Australian Lawyers Alliance made a submission to the royal commission earlier this month, urging it not to avoid scrutiny of offshore detention due to international borders. The group said \u201cpersuasive legal arguments\u201d supported the royal commission\u2019s ability to investigate offshore detention. The alliance is also concerned that the commission\u2019s terms of reference are too narrow, and that Monday\u2019s hearing was inadequate. Its submission warned that the immigration department\u2019s response to child sexual abuse had not gone far enough, and that the environment in offshore detention centres allowed \u201cthe risk of [child sexual abuse] to persist at unacceptable levels\u201d. \u201cThis royal commission has presented a comprehensive picture of institutional responses to [child sexual abuse] across Australia,\u201d the alliance\u2019s submission said. \u201cThis picture will not be complete without an investigation of the Commonwealth\u2019s response to [child sexual abuse] in immigration detention facilities,\u201d the submission said. \u201cIn offshore immigration detention, the need for investigation is urgent. Asylum seekers and refugees detained offshore lack access to mechanisms that are available in Australia to protect children from abuse and report any abuse that has occurred.\u201d Psychiatrist and expert on the impacts of abuse Louise Newman said detention was likely to leave many children with long-term psychological and emotional problems.

      "bodyText": "Replacing male figures in pedestrian crossing lights with women is a step towards gender equality and will \u201creduce unconscious bias\u201d, an Australian lobby group has said, as Melbourne rolled out a trial scheme on Tuesday. Ten lights at the intersection of Swanston and Flinders streets in the centre of Melbourne will be fitted out with female figures as part of a 12-month trial spearheaded by the Committee of Melbourne. The not-for-profit organisation comprising more than 120 community groups and businesses is striving for equal representation of men and women at all crossings across the state of Victoria with its Equal Crossing initiative. The initiative came at no cost to taxpayers \u2013 a spokeswoman specified that a local electrical company absorbed the cost as part of its sponsorship. The first lights changed were outside Flinders Street station on Tuesday. Martine Letts, the committee\u2019s chief executive, told the ABC that having only men represented at pedestrian crossings discriminated against women. \u201cThe idea is to install traffic lights with female representation, as well as male representation, to help reduce unconscious bias \u2026 We know that Melbourne is the world\u2019s most liveable city and we would really like to see Melbourne also known as the world\u2019s most equal city.\u201d Last year the City of Yarra area commemorated its first female councillor, Mary Rogers, in a walking signal at an intersection in Richmond. But the response to rolling out generic female figures to the rest of Melbourne has been mixed, with some criticising it as lip service towards gender equality. The lord mayor, Robert Doyle, was not impressed by the initiative. \u201cI\u2019m all for doing anything we can for gender equity, but really?\u201d he was quoted as saying by the Herald Sun. \u201cUnfortunately, I think this sort of costly exercise is more likely to bring derision.\u201d Letts told the ABC symbols were a \u201cpractical and meaningful way to demonstrate that in fact 50% of our population is female\u201d. A spokeswoman for the committee said, for the the trial to be extended beyond 12 months, \u201cthe risk assessment would have to be positive and we would need a legislative change via VicRoads\u201d. Melbourne is not the only city to recognise women at its pedestrian crossings. New Zealand celebrated being the first country to give women the vote by installing a silhouette of the suffragette Kate Sheppard at eight pedestrian crossings in the capital city Wellington in 2014. It immortalised a mayoral candidate and transgender woman last year. Ampelfrauen are widespread in several German cities \u2013in 2014 local politicians in Dortmund debated a 50% quota for women figures. Vienna installed lights depicting straight, gay and lesbian couples in 2015. Responding to Melbourne\u2019s initiative, the One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts posted an image to his Facebook page of one of these lights, showing two stick figures holding hands and glowing green. He commented: \u201cYou know what is coming next, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 10 March 2017.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has emphasised the importance of inclusion and mutual respect after Donald Trump\u2019s controversial decision to sign a revised executive order reinstating a ban on immigration from certain Muslim-majority countries and suspending the US refugee program. Speaking in Jakarta on Monday, in response to a question about Trump\u2019s renewed travel ban, and what Indonesia might think of it, Turnbull said Indonesia showed the world that democracy, Islam, moderation, tolerance were compatible. \u201cIslam is practised by about a quarter of the world\u2019s population and, in this country, we see a country with whom we are building closer ties \u2013 we see that democracy, Islam, moderation, tolerance are compatible,\u201d Turnbull told reporters. The prime minister said \u201cthe vast majority of Muslims in Australia are utterly appalled by extremism, by violent extremism, by terrorism\u201d and he said the success of Australia\u2019s multicultural project was \u201cbuilt on a foundation of mutual respect\u201d. \u201cIt is critical that we maintain that because that is why we have been so successful as a multicultural society.\u201d Trump\u2019s new travel ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six of the seven countries named in the president\u2019s original order \u2013 Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya \u2013 for 90 days. Iraq was removed from the new list because Iraq was considered an important strategic ally in the fight against Islamic State. US military and Pentagon officials in recent weeks have voiced concerns that the US relationship with Iraq would be negatively impacted by a revised travel ban. Turnbull noted on Monday that the best allies in the struggle against extremism were \u201cMuslim leaders like [the Indonesian president] Joko Widodo, the millions and billions of Muslims who are thoroughly committed to peace\u201d. Turnbull\u2019s comments could be read as implied criticism of Trump\u2019s exclusionary approach to national security issues. After being at pains for months not to pick fights, the Australian prime minister has also fired up in recent days against One Nation, criticising Pauline Hanson\u2019s controversial comments on childhood vaccinations on Sunday. In Jakarta on Monday, the prime minister was asked about the preference deal the West Australian Liberals have brokered with One Nation, and Turnbull used the question as a springboard to criticise One Nation\u2019s position on Muslims. He said all political leaders in Australia had a responsibility to send messages of inclusion and he said attempts to demonise all Muslims only played into the hands of terrorists. Turnbull said the preference deal in WA was designed to boost the fortunes of the Liberals. \u201cThose preference arrangements are an inevitable consequence of having preferential voting and they are always taken in the interest of the Liberal party.\u201d He said he hoped he had made himself clear on the importance of mutual respect. \u201cI just want to make another point about that as well \u2013 It is a very important one,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cWe are here [in Jakarta] signing a declaration about countering violent extremism and tackling terrorism.\u201d \u201cOne of the arguments of those who seek to do us harm make, this is the terrorists, they say ... that there is no place for Muslims in Australia. \u201cThat is how they seek to radicalise ... young Muslim Australians and we are tackling that right at the heart of it with strong, deradicalisation programs, working with Muslim communities. \u201cWhat I must do, as a leader, and what all leaders should do in Australia, is emphasise our inclusivity, the fact that we are a multicultural society where all cultures, all faiths are respected and that is mutual. \u201cSo, trying to demonise all Muslims is only confirming the lying, dangerous message of the terrorists.\u201d Hanson, who is on the campaign trail in Western Australia ahead of the state election, fired back at Turnbull late in the day on Twitter. With the WA election campaign entering its final week, Hanson used an interview with the Nine Network on Monday night to revive her criticism of Islam, declaring full face coverings \u201cwrong\u201d. Asked whether she was suspicious of all Muslims, Hanson replied: \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t feel that way, but a lot of Australians do feel that way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "No customers were interviewed for a report that cleared the Commonwealth Bank\u2019s insurance arm of alleged systemic problems because documents sufficiently told their story, the bank\u2019s chief executive, Ian Narev, has said. Appearing at a parliamentary committee hearing into the banks on Tuesday, Narev said he was concerned that some customers had poor experiences but claimed the insurance arm had not failed its customers generally. Committee members probed a Deloitte report into the CommInsure section, accused of routinely denying legitimate claims from sick and dying customers, for which Narev has already offered a personal apology. The report, released last week, did not identify any systemic issues relating to historically declined claims, despite the whistleblower and former chief medical officer Benjamin Koh warning that doctors were asked to change their medical assessments. On Tuesday Narev said that, despite some poor customer outcomes, it was clear from the Deloitte review that \u201cthe facts are at odds\u201d with claims made by Koh. Narev said that \u201cbroader conclusions drawn [about systemic denial of claims] are incorrect\u201d. The Liberal MP Julia Banks noted that, while the report cleared CommInsure of \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d, it also identified problems including poor staff training and lack of accuracy in reporting that could add to what she characterised as \u201cnegligent misconduct\u201d. The committee\u2019s chairman, the Liberal MP David Coleman, probed why CommInsure\u2019s board had a role in designing its terms of reference, which Banks described as \u201climited\u201d. Narev responded that the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority had found the Deloitte report was \u201crobust and independent\u201d and cited Deloitte\u2019s professional reputation. Based on the report it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that any senior executives would be terminated for their management of CommInsure. Narev said that no customers of CommInsure were interviewed as part of the review because Deloitte had \u201cunfettered access\u201d to hundreds and thousands of emails and files, making interviews with customers unnecessary. Narev refused to reveal how much Deloitte was paid for the report, citing commercial confidentiality. He refused to release two other reviews conducted by Ernst &amp; Young and DLA Piper on the basis staff and employees had been promised confidentiality if they engaged with them. With respect to two allegations of rate-rigging in foreign exchange trades between 2008 and 2013, Narev said the CBA had reached a settlement with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission in December. Narev said it was \u201cappropriate\u201d for the two individuals involved to have been terminated, and they were no longer with the bank, but senior managers should not be held accountable because the breaches didn\u2019t show broader problems with bank processes. He said individuals \u201cdetermined to circumvent\u201d policies was very serious but it was a low level of breach and therefore \u201cnot a major financial issue\u201d. Coleman asked about the fact that 1,800 of 8,600 financial advice customers whose cases were assessed \u2013 about 20% \u2013 had received compensation totalling $23m. Narev said that the review of the bank\u2019s financial advice went back to 2003 and contacted more than 300,000 customers. He agreed that those 1,800 customers \u201cdeserved the reparations they got\u201d. Narev also confirmed the CBA would refund $105.1m, plus interest, for 40,000 customers who were charged financial advice fees despite not being allocated a financial adviser. He recognised that was a \u201csignificant\u201d amount of money and customers affected but said the error was not intentional but the result of \u201cpoor implementation\u201d. Coleman quizzed Narev about a committee proposal to require banks to publicly disclose breaches of licence conditions soon after reporting them to Asic, including naming managers responsible for sections involved. In opposing the proposal, Narev said that public reporting of breaches occurred expeditiously, often before managerial responsibility and disciplinary consequences had been determined. \u201cExecutives are entitled to due process,\u201d he said. Narev suggested that disclosing disciplinary consequences in annual reporting to shareholders would be more appropriate. Narev reiterated the CBA\u2019s opposition to a bank royal commission. He said it would send a \u201cvery damaging message\u201d of low confidence in policymakers, regulators and bank management.",

Children who were abused in out-of-home care made up a staggering 40% of private sessions with the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. The royal commission has referred 361 cases of abuse in out-of-home care to police. The data was released on Tuesday as the royal commission turns its focus back to state, territory and commonwealth governments, seeking to understand what they have done to respond to its findings. The commission on Tuesday began to press state and territory governments on whether they will commit to the single national redress scheme to compensate survivors, which was announced by the federal government in November. Senior bureaucrats from New South Wales, Victoria, Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland were all reluctant to fully commit to a national redress scheme, saying they were supportive but needed more detail from the commonwealth. South Australia appeared the least willing, and suggested a redress system might serve only to \u201cretraumatise\u201d survivors.

The acting provincial police commander, Senior Inspector David Yapu, confirmed that a 28-year-old Pakistani refugee was arrested Monday. He is alleged to have lured the girl to the Kohai Lodge in Lorengau township, where he is accused of assaulting her. The man has been charged with four counts of sexual penetration of a child. He is expected to appear in Lorengau court Wednesday afternoon.

We will make sure that they [Australian authorities] also will be the target of a class action lawsuit for crimes against Manus people. \u201cI demand they secure these people and remove them forthwith before our local people massacre them.\u201d Knight has consistently warned that brooding tensions between Manusians and the refugee population could escalate to serious violence. Monday\u2019s alleged assault is the second reported incident of sexual assault in Lorengau town involving the transferred population of refugees and asylum seekers. In January an asylum seeker was arrested and charged over the alleged assault of a 19-year-old student at the Harbourside Hotel. He has been bailed to appear in court at a later date. The arrest of a refugee forcibly transferred to Manus Island comes at a delicate time for the PNG and Australian governments. The Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, is reportedly scheduled to meet her PNG counterpart Rimbink Pato at Madang on PNG\u2019s north coast this week, as part of the 25th PNG-Australia Ministerial Forum. PNG\u2019s lingering dismay over the Manus Island detention centre has been previously raised in this meeting. The PNG government is pushing Australia to close the detention centre as quickly as possible and remove the men held there from Manus Island. The PNG supreme court ruled the detention centre \u2018illegal and unconstitutional\u2019 more than 10 months ago, and the government has openly stated the camp is a problem and wants it shuttered. Ferrovial, owner of Broadspectrum, the private contractor employed to operate the offshore detention regime, is refusing to run the camps beyond the end of its current contract in October. Officials from the United States are on the island for preliminary interviews regarding resettlement of refugees in America, but there is significant uncertainty that that deal will go ahead. The US could take zero, or a handful of refugees from Manus, and still be upholding the deal it struck with Australia, which obliges it only to consider refugees for resettlement.",

The job losses will start immediately in support areas in the TV news and television divisions, and move on to content areas later in the year. The executive team will be reduced from 14 to eight and powerful new overarching roles have been created for former Nova executive Louise Higgins and current ABC executives Samantha Liston and Leisa Bacon. Citing \u201cred tape\u201d, \u201cduplication\u201d and \u201cover-management\u201d, Guthrie told staff in a national address on Tuesday that they had to break down the silos between news, radio, TV and digital, and work together to create content audiences wanted. \u201cWe lack the flexibility to quickly adjust to the fast-changing audience trends,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cOur reach on television and radio is declining and digital is struggling to bridge the divide. \u201cWe have significant audience gaps: socially, culturally and geographically.

She is the first female managing director of the ABC and came to the job with no experience in content making or public broadcasting. Since her arrival four members of the executive team have resigned including David Pendleton, digital director Angela Clark, international director Lynley Marshall and director of television Richard Finlayson. Guthrie told staff she would welcome ideas for programming the 6pm to 7pm TV time slot. \u201cFor example, I\u2019d love a creative solution that gives us a strong lead-in to the all-important 7pm ABC News program,\u201d she told a packed room at Ultimo. Guthrie said an additional $15m a year would be spent on targeting audiences in regional and rural Australia and within 18 months 80 new jobs would be created. \u201cWe want to ensure that the stories, issues and interests of the one-third of Australians who live outside the capital cities are well-represented across the gamut of ABC services and have a stronger voice in national conversations,\u201d she said. A new $50m content fund created by cuts to middle management would allow the ABC to \u201crespond with flexibility and speed to shifting audience trends\u201d, Guthrie said. Audiences who are infrequent ABC users would be a focus. The ABC board issued a statement of support for Guthrie\u2019s vision, saying it had been involved in the planning over the past 10 months. \u201cThe change program over the next 12 months will transform the corporation,\u201d the statement said. \u201cImportantly, it provides content makers with the flexibility and resources they need to address audience and technological changes that are sweeping through the media sector. \u201cThe new structure also strengthens the corporation, with its emphasis on operational efficiency, reduced management layers and the creation of a new audiences division to align ABC programming and content strategy with audience tastes and trends.\u201d",

According to this plotline, populism is a beast that can be harnessed by political outsiders who reflect the disenfranchisement of the masses, be they a reality TV con-man or a redheaded fishmonger. Populism rises. It bites back, it tames, it demands action, it rejects orthodoxy. Populism is a living thing. But populism is complex, more a piece of music, a series of chords and melodies of society\u2019s collective and sometimes contradictory song-lines. Surveying last week\u2019s reaction to the Fair Work Commission\u2019s decision to cut Sunday penalty rates showcases that complexity. The major parties occupied predictable corners, the Coalition seeking to wave the decision through with a minimum of fuss, the opposition going to the barricades, talking of legislation to reduce the impact of commission\u2019s ruling. While the majors were playing to their natural (if diminishing) bases, the capital labour divide in stark relief, it was the position of the self-styled populists that was less predictable. Drawing on her experience as a small business operator, Pauline Hanson instinctively backed the decision to cut penalty rates, mirroring the position of that other skilled populist of the current political era, Nick Xenophon. The only problem with this approach? As this week\u2019s Essential Report illustrates, the populist position on penalty rates is not really very popular. The figures show the clear break on partisan lines between the major parties, but more significant is the \u201cother column\u201d, dominated as it is by One Nation, Xenophon and independent voters. It is these \u201cother\u201d views on penalty rates that are starkly at odds with the position of the people who are drawing their votes in in increasing numbers. A similar split can be seen when votes are asked to choose between the competing views on the impact of the penalty rate cuts. While Coalition voters are evenly split on the repercussions of cutting weekend rates, supporters of the populist \u201cothers\u201d are on the same page as Labor and Green voters as dismissing the promise of more jobs as a chimera. And when it comes to intervening in the commission\u2019s activities there is a similar break to the political left by the progressives. In crude political terms, these numbers show that penalty rate cuts could be just as damaging to Pauline Hanson as they are to Malcolm Turnbull, a tangible proof point that for all her outsider rhetoric, she is basically a Liberal when it comes to workers\u2019 rights. She has, after all, backed the Coalition on each of its three anti-union legislative forays, reinstating the Australian Building and Construction Commission with its coercive powers, reversing protections for owner-drivers, intervening to prevent professional fire fighters bargaining collectively. Penalty rates represent a more personal break with the popular will that could give pause to those attracted by other parts of her bleak worldview, from banning Muslim immigrants to cracking down on welfare recipients. University of NSW academic and author David McKnight has been grappling with populism in recent times and is working on a book that I think helps make sense of this contradiction. McKnight sees two competing strands of populism playing out through the current political debate. \u201cHistorically, populism is based on the recognition that ordinary people have different interests to the dominant elite,\u201d he argues. \u201cThis can be the basis of both reactionary or progressive populism depending on who constitutes this elite.\u201d Reactionary populists target cultural elites, pushing back on minority rights, government spending, liberal social policies, the sort of agenda Tony Abbott unleased a couple of weeks ago. Progressive populists like Bernie Sanders hone in more on the business elites that are driving economic liberalism, corporate excess and tax evasion, the destruction of job security and workers rights. While the targets are different, the audience of disenfranchised is the same. The critical issue becomes which of the populist veins is tapped. For example, McKnight argues people are constantly told that deregulation will increase prosperity but the example of penalty rates shows that this leads to decreases to wellbeing and, in the longer term, the creation of gross social inequality. These same people are living the deregulation of the workplace that has seen the creation of a new underclass of temporary migrant workers. This is ultimately aimed at creating a pool of cheap labour to undercut local conditions and jobs. And it is that same deregulation fuelling grievances that express themselves as anti-foreigner xenophobia. Reactionary populists enter the fray at this point, tapping the discontent with deregulation by calling for bans on immigration, without questioning the broader chain of logic. In contrast, progressive populism goes to the source. \u201cBuilding a progressive populist movement means finding the way to build a coalition of everyday Australians to combat the elite that controls both the deregulated economy and destructive businesses based on burning coal and oil,\u201d McKnight argues. As the US election showed, this means defining the political contest around class and economics, rather than getting dragged back into cultural and identity wars. The response to the penalty rates decision is just a small part of that puzzle, but it does show how this populist flip can be executed.",
