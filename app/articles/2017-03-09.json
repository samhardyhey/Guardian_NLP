Like we were all involved in \u2018the experiment\u2019, which is what we labeled it. \u201cSo it was this kind of evolving project and we were all just trying things out and taking risks, which was really incredible. I think everyone felt like they were part of \u2018something\u2019.\u201d Sometimes it takes a great work of art to remind us of the humanity inside a tragic, unfathomable event. Errol Morris\u2019s The Thin Blue Line is one such movie: Kitty Green\u2019s Casting JonBen\u00e9t is now another. \u201cA lot of people have come up to me and said that for the first time they can empathise with the family,\u201d says Green. \u201cNot because they thought they were \u2018guilty\u2019 or \u2018innocent\u2019, but just because [the film] humanised the tragedy in some way.\u201d \u201cRather than it just being a whodunnit, it became about a loss of life, which was really important to me.\u201d \u2022 Casting JonBen\u00e9t will screen on Netflix in April",

Presented with a large picture of the Rockingham MP by the ABC\u2019s AM program this week, one Perth woman confidently asserted that he was \u201cnot on the media at all\u201d. Another gave his name as Peter McGowan, and when asked to describe him in three words, said: \u201cNot very interesting.\u201d It was not a particularly comforting message to receive on the eve of an election. Polls show Labor with a two-party-preferred lead of 54% to 46% against the incumbent Liberal-National government, led by premier Colin Barnett, whom McGowan has been beating in preferred premier ratings for about two years. However analysts say favourable polling, which points towards a swing towards Labor in the region of 10% on Saturday, is a reaction against the long-serving Barnett government rather than a show of support for McGowan. \u201cPeople are not going to vote Labor because of Mark McGowan,\u201d Murdoch University senior political lecturer Ian Cook said. While Barnett evokes strong reactions from both supporters and detractors, response to McGowan is mild. He is competent, affable and stubbornly unmemorable; a Clark Kent who does not know how to turn into superman. At a campaign shopping centre visit in Perth\u2019s northern suburbs this week, a woman who had stopped to shake McGowan\u2019s hand remarked that he seemed like a nice man. Not an \u201cordinary person\u201d in the parlance used by One Nation to describe a particular kind of firebrand battler, but a genuinely ordinary person. Flanked by popular Labor stalwart Alannah MacTiernan and Amber-Jade Sanderson, the candidate for the seat of Morley, McGowan walked through the shopping centre shaking hands and nodding at shopkeepers, offering a slightly flat performance that could charitably be attributed to the fatigue of campaigning. He has stuck to his talking points throughout, frustrating efforts of ABC 7.30 host Leigh Sales to elicit more genuine responses, and maintained a facade that prompted federal minister Christian Porter, a former state treasurer who was once tipped to become premier of WA, to call him a \u201cjunior, sweaty navy lawyer.\u201d McGowan, who did indeed act as a legal officer with the Australian Navy, stationed at the HMAS Stirling naval base in Rockingham, described the comment as \u201cgrubby and nasty\u201d. The 49-year-old was elected to state parliament in 1996 and served as a minister in the Gallop government until Labor lost power to Barnett in 2008. He won the Labor leadership following the resignation of opposition leader Eric Ripper in 2012, after previously losing bids for both the leader and deputy leader positions in 2008. The party has since rallied around him, despite a brief leadership challenge from former federal Labor minister Stephen Smith, and is reportedly briefing that it expects to win between 13 and 15 seats, well above the 10 seats needed to secure a change of government. Despite the polling, which due to Australia\u2019s compulsory voting system is less fallible than polls that failed to predict both Donald Trump\u2019s election and the Brexit outcome, McGowan insists he is the \u201cunderdog\u201d. \u201cI think we\u2019re the underdogs because we have to win 10 seats on a 10% margin and the Liberal party is doing everything it can to try and hold on to office including its deal with One Nation,\u201d McGowan told ABC radio this week. The preference deal between One Nation and the Liberal party, in which the Liberals are giving preferences to One Nation in the upper house in exchange for One Nation preferences in the lower house, is both a threat and an asset to Labor. It could net One Nation as many as three seats in the upper house, but it also caused dissent among the ranks of One Nation candidates and has been viewed unfavourably by Liberal party faithful. Barnett, who was planning to retire before taking the Liberal leadership and winning the election in 2008, has said he will see out the full term on the backbench if Labor wins the election, and is expected to handover the premiership to deputy Liza Harvey if they do not. \u201cI\u2019m still planning on winning this election or giving it my best shot,\u201d he told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m not about to concede because I think there is going to be unpredicted results, particularly in country electorates, and particularly maybe in some outer metropolitan ones where you\u2019ve got some very strong candidates.\u201d",

In an interview with Radio National on Friday, the treasurer also signalled that the government would cut or redirect funds from the $1.3bn-a-year national affordable housing agreement, saying he was \u201cvery frustrated\u201d with its performance. Under the bond aggregator model, the commonwealth would raise up to $200m through government bonds, which could be used to give loans to community housing providers or the private sector to provide social or affordable housing. On Friday Morrison announced a new affordable housing taskforce to develop the bond aggregator model, to be led by the former chief executive of the New South Wales Treasury Corporation Stephen Knight, and including the Treasury secretary, John Fraser, and the chief executive of the Community Housing Industry Association, Peta Winzar. The taskforce will report by mid year. On Radio National Morrison said the model worked overseas to help make new developments commercially viable \u2013 including in the UK, where he studied the scheme on a visit in January. Morrison said the proposal would help \u201cthe growing number of people on low incomes who are facing rental stress\u201d. The treasurer said an affordable housing finance corporation would be \u201cnot the whole solution, but it has certainly been part of the solution in many parts of the world\u201d, suggesting it will form one plank of the government\u2019s housing package in the May budget. Asked if the proposal would benefit only renters, Morrison said \u201cthere are models to enable [people] to eventually buy the houses in the circumstances\u201d, suggesting a rent-to-buy scheme was also under consideration. The chief executive of the NSW Federation of Housing Associations, Wendy Hayhurst, welcomed the announcement, saying that attracting large scale institutional investment would be \u201ccritical to establishing the community housing sector as a third tier of the Australian housing market\u201d. The Greens housing spokeswoman Lee Rhiannon labelled the plan a \u201cweak\u201d version of its policy to issue $2bn worth of loans through an affordable housing corporation. Morrison said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with the performance of the national affordability agreement, which has cost the federal government $9bn so far. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated with it because we spent all of that money and the number of people on housing waiting lists has gone up and the number of houses owned in public housing has gone down and the number in rental stress on low incomes has gone up \u2013 so [it was] $9bn very badly spent.\u201d Homelessness services have warned that ending the $1.3bn a year agreement for public housing and homelessness services would be an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d for those sleeping rough, effectively cutting two-thirds of funding from specialist homelessness services. Asked if the $1.3bn would be redirected to an affordable housing finance corporation, Morrison noted the bond program was an \u201coff-balance sheet\u201d arrangement, meaning it would not add to government debt in the budget. Morrison said the government\u2019s plan was \u201cnot necessarily\u201d about reducing the national affordable housing agreement, but the funds had to be spent better. Morrison equivocated on whether the funds would be cut, promising only that the government would spend the money better but \u201cultimate decisions \u2026 will have to be taken in the context of the challenges that we have more broadly in the budget\u201d. Rhiannon said the bond aggregator should not be an excuse to abolish direct funding through a national agreement. \u201cThe national affordable housing agreement should be reformed and complement the aggregator if the government is serious about housing affordability and security.\u201d Asked about comments by UniSuper\u2019s chief executive, Chris Cuffe, that there was \u201cno justification\u201d for capital gains tax discounts on properties that were resold after just a year, Morrison said the average investment property was held for eight and a half years, and the discount was introduced \u201cto simplify tax arrangements in a high interest high inflation environment\u201d. Morrison said he \u201cdidn\u2019t necessarily agree\u201d with case-by-case reductions to the capital gains tax discount because the current discount was simpler for taxpayers and the tax office. He did not rule out any changes to capital gains tax in the budget. Morrison said a report on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 on Thursday that Malcolm Turnbull would take the lead on economic issues did not mean he had been sidelined, because \u201cthe prime minister is always the chief economic spokesperson\u201d of the government. \u201cAlways has been, always should be \u2013 the prime minister is leading the country and there is no greater challenge than continuing the prosperity we\u2019ve enjoyed for the last 26 years.\u201d Morrison said he and the prime minister were \u201ca team\u201d and worked on the budget together. The 7.30 report also suggested Turnbull would conduct a reshuffle after the budget, with attorney general George Brandis to move on either to become high commissioner in London or to another prominent position. Brandis is likely to be replaced by the social services minister, Christian Porter, or the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, it said. His position as government leader in the Senate is expected to go to the finance minister, Mathias Cormann.",

The left-leaning Australia Institute and Centre for Future Work has released data showing the traditional measure of the gender pay gap (which has women earning 17% less than men) for ordinary pay, equivalent full-time positions is blown out when the concentration of women in part-time work is taken into account. The data also shows women account for 55% of all employment in the retail sector and 53% in food and beverage services. The two sectors are the largest employers of women in the private-sector economy. In food and beverages 70% of women work part-time compared with 52% of men. In retail 60% of the women employed work part-time compared with 35% of men. When the disproportionate number of women working part-time is taken into account, the gender pay gap increases from 17% to 33% in Australia. Economist and the director of the Centre for Future Work, Jim Stanford, said it was impossible to separate the impact of the pure gender pay gap from the impact of women\u2019s concentration in part-time work. \u201cBoth factors undermine women\u2019s earnings and the penalty rate cut will have a further negative effect on that,\u201d he said. Last month the Fair Work Commission announced a decision to cut Sunday penalty rates across the hospitality, retail and pharmacy industries with some exceptions. In hospitality penalty rates will fall from 175% to 150% on Sunday and in retail it will fall from 200% to 150% for full and part-time employees and 175% for casuals. United Voice and the SDA made submissions that a cut to penalty rates would disproportionally affect women but the Fair Work Commission rejected the proposition. The FWC decision said that to show women were disproportionately affected \u201cit would have to be shown that more female hospitality workers usually work on Sundays than males\u201d. There was \u201cno data\u201d that showed the number of hospitality workers who usually work on Sundays, by gender, it said. \u201cFurther, the available data does not appear to support the proposition advanced.\u201d The FWC said that in data drawn from the ABS Working Time Arrangements series it shows that across surveys conducted in 2006, 2009 and 2012 the proportion of male employees who usually work on Sundays was greater than the proportion of female employees who usually work on Sundays. \u201cBut this is \u2018all industries\u2019 data,\u201d the decision said. \u201cIt is not confined to the retail industry.\u201d The minister for women, Michaelia Cash, rebuked Bill Shorten on Wednesday for arguing the cuts to penalty rates would disproportionately affect women, saying his claims were not backed by data. The Unions NSW assistant secretary, Emma Maiden, said the new analysis was clear and the Turnbull government was failing women. \u201cCuts to penalty rates for retail and hospitality workers will impose a higher burden on women workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThese women can least afford it and certainly don\u2019t deserve it. \u201cThe Turnbull government should show their support for working women and their commitment to equality by agreeing to overturn this pay cut.\u201d The latest Guardian Essential Poll showed 56% of respondents disapproved of the penalty rates cut and 57% of the survey said they believed the most likely result of the change will be bigger profits for business, not more jobs in retail and hospitality. Only 24% of people think the cut will result in business employing more workers, which was a key part of the reasoning behind the FWC\u2019s decision.",

With iron ore back trading around US$90 a tonne, after dropping dangerously low in 2015-16, those companies ought to be able to bear the extra cost.</p> <p>In return the WA government would be able to recoup an extra $2.3bn a year and attempt to plug the hole in the state budget, which crashed along with commodities prices and is now headed towards a $3bn deficit and a net debt of $41bn by 2020.</p> <p>On paper, it makes sense. Advertising by the National party compares the increase to the change in the price of milk. The special lease fee was set more than 50 years ago and is still referred to in some agreements as two and sixpence, they argue. Why should it not be increased?</p> <p>According to the mining lobby, the cost of imposing the tax would far outweigh its value as a revenue source. In a report commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia, economists from Deloitte Access Economics predicted it would cause the Australian economy to shrink by $2.9bn a year and cause 7,200 job losses Australia-wide, of which 3,400 would be in WA and 2,900 would be in the Pilbara.</p> <p>BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto together employ about 17,500 people in their iron ore divisions in WA and a further 15,000 contractors.</p> <p>The report also warned that unilaterally changing a state agreement, which is a contractual arrangement set out in an act of parliament, increased sovereign risk, made WA less attractive to investors and could be unconstitutional. </p> <p>\u201cIt really goes to the heart of sovereign risk and that\u2019s why I think there is the support [from the industry],\u201d Reg Howard-Smith, chief executive of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, tells Guardian Australia. \u201cPeople have parked their competitive issues and raised the bar and said: no, this is part of how the resource industry operates in WA.\u201d</p> <p>Howard-Smith says despite Australia\u2019s incredibly low sovereign risk rating, compared with its direct competitors in iron ore, the increased risk caused by unilaterally changing a state agreement, combined with an additional cost that he put at $3bn a year, will make Australia a less attractive place to do business.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Household fees and charges are going to have to increase substantially if you don\u2019t have a new revenue source</p> <footer> <cite>Brendon Grylls</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Both mining companies already pay, at a conservative estimate, US$19 a tonne on royalties, taxes and other charges.</p> <p>He also says there\u2019s a strong argument that the special lease fee is no longer applicable to the agreements as they operate today, because it was imposed to help the state government recoup the set-up costs of establishing towns and roads to support new mining projects, and those towns are no longer company-controlled.</p> <p>It\u2019s a familiar playbook for the mining industry, which used many of the same arguments, with great success, to oppose both the resources super profits tax and the mineral resources rent tax.</p> <p>In both cases the campaign played a significant role in the downfall of a prime minister, first Kevin Rudd in 2010 then Julia Gillard in 2013.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole story of the MRRT and Rudd and Gillard was that it worked,\u201d says Jeffrey<em> </em>Wilson, a senior lecturer in international political economy at Murdoch University. \u201cThey basically brought down the prime minister on this.

      "bodyText": "Five months ago, pictures of macaws started popping up on the screensavers of employees at BHP Billiton\u2019s iron ore operations in Port Hedland, 1,500km north of Perth. The colourful image came with a warning. \u201cIncreasing WA iron ore royalties by $5 would make them seven times higher than our biggest competitor Brazil,\u201d it read. \u201cWhat\u2019s at risk if WA mining is made uncompetitive?\u201d The target of the message was the local MP, Brendon Grylls. As leader of the Western Australian National party, Grylls had suggested increasing a minor charge attached to some of the state\u2019s oldest and most established iron ore mines from $0.25 a tonne to $5 a tonne, in line with inflation. It\u2019s a policy that could cost the 43-year-old his seat at Saturday\u2019s state election if a $5m advertising campaign by the mining lobby succeeds in convincing his hardhat-wearing constituents that the proposal could cost them their jobs. Grylls says he\u2019s not worried. \u201cI\u2019m the member for the Pilbara, I wouldn\u2019t have campaigned on it if I thought it would put my seat of the Pilbara at risk,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cAs for the rest of the voters in Western Australia, if the Pilbara communities think that it would be fair to charge an updated rental to BHP and Rio Tinto, well then, the rest of Western Australia should be quite happy with it because you would have thought that it would have the greatest effect in the Pilbara.\u201d It\u2019s a risky strategy. Grylls\u2019 electorate stretches from the Northern Territory border to the coast just below Karratha, another mining hub 240km south-west of Port Hedland. There are streets in Port Hedland where every house is owned by BHP Billiton, inhabited by a BHP Billiton employee who has been encouraged by the company to vote against Grylls. At the southern edge of the electorate sits Newman, a town founded by BHP to house workers for the Mount Whaleback mine in the late 1960s. Mount Whaleback was established under a state agreement in 1964 and is one of the projects for which the special lease fee applies. On Wednesday BHP Billiton stepped up its campaign, comparing the proposed mining tax to cost pressures faced by the Australian car industry, and again warning that Brazil could capture the market. \u201cThe automotive industry here was not competitive globally and look what the consequences were,\u201d Mike Henry, head of BHP Billiton\u2019s minerals division in Australia, told the ABC. \u201cWe need to ensure that our industry remains competitive, [and is] able to compete with the Brazilians and others globally.\u201d Henry also suggested the company\u2019s funding to community projects would have to be cut to make up the cost. Despite the industry campaign, which Grylls said had been \u201csurprising\u201d in its level of \u201cpersonal vitriol\u201d, he said he had received \u201cstrong support\u201d for the proposal on the campaign trail. A ReachTel poll conducted for Fairfax Media on Saturday found 39.4% of voters surveyed supported the policy and 37.1% opposed, a result both Grylls and the mining lobby quickly parsed into a victory for their cause by each claiming the undecided 23.5%. The $0.25 a tonne charge, called the special lease rental fee, was negotiated in the 60s and never updated. It applies to mines operated by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, the two biggest mining companies in Australia, as well as the smaller Cliffs Natural Resources. Under the proposal by the National party the fee increase would apply only to BHP Billiton and Rio, companies that had successfully reduced their cost of production to below US$30 a tonne in an attempt to undercut their smaller competitors. With iron ore back trading around US$90 a tonne, after dropping dangerously low in 2015-16, those companies ought to be able to bear the extra cost. In return the WA government would be able to recoup an extra $2.3bn a year and attempt to plug the hole in the state budget, which crashed along with commodities prices and is now headed towards a $3bn deficit and a net debt of $41bn by 2020. On paper, it makes sense. Advertising by the National party compares the increase to the change in the price of milk. The special lease fee was set more than 50 years ago and is still referred to in some agreements as two and sixpence, they argue. Why should it not be increased? According to the mining lobby, the cost of imposing the tax would far outweigh its value as a revenue source. In a report commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia, economists from Deloitte Access Economics predicted it would cause the Australian economy to shrink by $2.9bn a year and cause 7,200 job losses Australia-wide, of which 3,400 would be in WA and 2,900 would be in the Pilbara. BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto together employ about 17,500 people in their iron ore divisions in WA and a further 15,000 contractors. The report also warned that unilaterally changing a state agreement, which is a contractual arrangement set out in an act of parliament, increased sovereign risk, made WA less attractive to investors and could be unconstitutional. \u201cIt really goes to the heart of sovereign risk and that\u2019s why I think there is the support [from the industry],\u201d Reg Howard-Smith, chief executive of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, tells Guardian Australia. \u201cPeople have parked their competitive issues and raised the bar and said: no, this is part of how the resource industry operates in WA.\u201d Howard-Smith says despite Australia\u2019s incredibly low sovereign risk rating, compared with its direct competitors in iron ore, the increased risk caused by unilaterally changing a state agreement, combined with an additional cost that he put at $3bn a year, will make Australia a less attractive place to do business. Both mining companies already pay, at a conservative estimate, US$19 a tonne on royalties, taxes and other charges. He also says there\u2019s a strong argument that the special lease fee is no longer applicable to the agreements as they operate today, because it was imposed to help the state government recoup the set-up costs of establishing towns and roads to support new mining projects, and those towns are no longer company-controlled. It\u2019s a familiar playbook for the mining industry, which used many of the same arguments, with great success, to oppose both the resources super profits tax and the mineral resources rent tax. In both cases the campaign played a significant role in the downfall of a prime minister, first Kevin Rudd in 2010 then Julia Gillard in 2013. \u201cThe whole story of the MRRT and Rudd and Gillard was that it worked,\u201d says Jeffrey Wilson, a senior lecturer in international political economy at Murdoch University. \u201cThey basically brought down the prime minister on this. So if it worked then, they\u2019ll just give it another go.\u201d In a paper in the Australian Journal of Political Science, published this month, Wilson analysed the campaign against the MRRT and found there was no evidence the tax posed a direct threat to the sustainability of the mining industry. He also found that when it comes to the success of a campaign of this nature, the evidence, or lack of it, does not matter. That\u2019s particularly true in WA, he says, where mining companies occupy some of the tallest towers in Perth\u2019s St Georges Terrace business district. \u201cThey own the Terrace and they own the WA Liberal party completely,\u201d he said. The Liberal party, which has shared government with the Nationals for the past nine years under the premier, Colin Barnett, but is not a formal Coalition partner as the Liberal and National parties are in the eastern states, opposes the lease increase. So too does the Labor party, under the opposition leader, Mark McGowan, and One Nation, which has targeted the Pilbara as part of a campaign to gain ground in regional WA electorates. If Grylls retains his seat on Saturday, with the help of his existing 11.5% margin, the National party would have to get the balance of power to have any chance of shepherding the proposed changes through parliament. \u201cWhoever wins government is going to have to frame a budget in very tricky financial circumstances for Western Australia,\u201d he says. \u201cHousehold fees and charges are going to have to increase substantially if you don\u2019t have a new revenue source. Government programs are going to have to be cut to try and stabilise the state\u2019s finances. \u201cAt that point every West Australian who has been bombarded on the TV screen from the mining company\u2019s ads is going to say, \u2018Explain to me again why we\u2019re losing government services and infrastructure spending and why our fees and charges are going up but BHP and Rio\u2019s seem to be quarantined and quarantined with the support of both Mark McGowan and Colin Barnett?\u2019 I think they\u2019re going to find that very difficult to defend.\u201d",

Inside job ABC management has chastised union leader Sinddy Ealy for doing an interview with ABC News reporter Andrew Robertson inside the Southbank headquarters in Melbourne. \u201cAs you would be aware, under s.484 of the Fair Work Act, you may enter the ABC\u2019s premises for the purposes of holding discussions with employees,\u201d an email from human resources to the secretary of the ABC section of the CPSU said. \u201cIt has come to my attention that you were filmed walking along the corridor in the ABC\u2019s Southbank premises on 7 March 2017 and then provided an interview to an ABC journalist from the same premises \u2026 I am concerned that you have misused your rights of entry.\u201d As we understand it, Ealy was not at the ABC to meet with her members but was asked by the reporter to turn up for an interview about the ABC restructure.",

The \u201crobo debt\u201d system slugged almost 97,300 Australians with a 10% recovery fee in the last six months of 2016. The fee has been applied to two of every three debts raised under the robo debt system. The 10% penalty has traditionally been used to punish those who fail to give accurate income information to Centrelink, where they either have no \u201creasonable excuse\u201d or deliberately withheld details. Under the old system, Centrelink officers would contact the debtor and give them a chance to explain. The officers would then assess whether it was reasonable for the person not to have provided Centrelink with the information. But the new system, in many cases, is simply imposing the penalty automatically. The National Social Security Rights Network\u2019s executive officer, Matthew Butt, believes that is unlawful. He has called for the use of the penalty to be stopped. \u201cThe minister says that the system is about ensuring people get what they are entitled to, no more, no less,\u201d Butt said. \u201cThe penalty should be removed [including retrospectively].\u201d The Department of Human Services has rejected the allegation, saying it is imposing the fee in accordance with the social security law. \u201cThe social security law provides for an additional 10% penalty to be applied to an earnings related debt where a person has failed or refused to provide information about their earnings related income,\u201d the department spokesman Hank Jongen said. \u201cThe legislation provides that the 10% penalty is to be applied to a relevant debt unless the decision maker is satisfied that the person had a reasonable excuse for failing or refusing to the provide the information,\u201d Jongen said. The government\u2019s own guidelines to social security law state that discretion must be used to determine whether an individual has a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d for failing to provide Centrelink with accurate information. That means it must be decided on a case by case basis and according to individual circumstances. The guidelines state that decision-makers must take into account a person\u2019s age, health, level of education, literacy and other personal factors. \u201cWhen determining if a person has a reasonable excuse for failing to declare income, the person\u2019s circumstances must be considered,\u201d the guidelines say. The automated system does not do this, according to Butt. The system does ask whether an individual\u2019s personal circumstances prevented them from reporting accurately. Butt says this does not go far enough. He says the system still effectively automates a decision that should be made using individual discretion. \u201cThere appears to be a question in the new system intended to give people some opportunity to explain,\u201d Butt said. \u201cBut it is voluntary and some of our clients did not answer it. \u201cBut, even with this question, we still have serious concerns that the use of a computer system to apply this penalty is in breach of basic principles of administrative law.\u201d The 10% fee is being imposed automatically when a welfare recipient does not receive or respond to Centrelink\u2019s correspondence about their debt. It can also be imposed when a person logs on to Centrelink\u2019s online system and simply confirms that the information from the Australian taxation office is accurate. The now defunct Administrative Review Council found in 2004 that automating discretionary decisions would be in breach of administrative law. It found that \u201cexpert systems should not automate the exercise of discretion\u201d. \u201cIt is the council\u2019s view that the automation of discretion is not in accordance with the administrative law values of lawfulness and fairness because it could fetter the decision maker in the exercise of their discretionary power,\u201d the council found. Butt said that view applied directly to the robo debt system. \u201cWe hold the same view and think that it is likely to breach this rule against fettering to continue to apply the 10% penalty with the [online compliance intervention] system,\u201d he said. The department said the penalty could be removed later if welfare recipients could prove they had a reasonable excuse. \u201cWe strongly encourage anyone who is contacted by the department about a debt to respond and keep us updated. When we are informed about changes or difficulties they are experiencing, we can help tailor a solution for their situation,\u201d Jongen said. \u201cWhile we\u2019re required to recover overpayments, we can work with people to set up repayment plans appropriate to their circumstances and in some cases defer debt recovery.\u201d The system does ask welfare recipients whether there were any personal circumstances that stopped them from providing accurate information to Centrelink in the past. It also gives them the chance to ask for a reassessment, lodge an appeal, or make a complaint. The guidelines also say that the fee can be imposed if individuals fail to respond to Centrelink within 21 days.

He was discovered hanging shortly after midnight on Saturday night and taken by ambulance to Fiona Stanley hospital, where he was placed in the intensive care unit and remains in a coma. His family have gathered at his bedside for five days and have been told by doctors that he will not recover. Anderson, a Noongar man and father of two daughters, had been in custody on remand for several months and was due to appear in court on a number of charges next week. His father, Lyle Anderson, was taken on Wednesday to see the cell where his son was discovered and said police had already begun their coronial investigation into a death in custody, despite his son still being on life support. \u201cHe was in a punishment cell,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said it happened between 10.20pm and 12.20pm \u2013 there\u2019s a two-hour window.\u201d Anderson senior said he had questions about what had happened to his son, both before and after the apparent suicide attempt, and had sought permission to speak to his cellmates. \u201cSome of the boys that I spoke to there said that it happened about nine or 10,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was already braindead when they found him.\u201d In a statement, the Department of Corrective Services confirmed a 23-year-old man had been taken by ambulance to the hospital in the early hours of Sunday morning. The family, including two siblings brought in handcuffs from other WA prisons, have been saying their goodbyes to Anderson and are expected to turn off his life support. Uncle Ben Taylor, a Noongar elder and great-great uncle of Jordan Anderson, was among those gathered at the bedside on Thursday. \u201cI just sat his bed for half an hour, intensive care,\u201d Taylor told Guardian Australia. \u201cNow these idiot doctors come down and said they are going to shut down the machines.\u201d The 77-year-old said he had been to too many deathbeds of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people caught up in the justice system. Monday marked the fourth anniversary of the death in custody of another young Noongar man, Jayden Bennell, who died in an assumed suicide attempt at Casuarina prison in 2013. The findings of a coronial inquest into his death, held last year, are expected to be handed down this month. \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636",

We put out a monthly newspaper and ran a bookstore in deepest, darkest conservative Orange County. We all worked together, but there were plenty of gender assumptions at play. I refused to learn to make coffee or type so that I couldn\u2019t be stuck with those mundane tasks. The women in the group met in a consciousness-raising group. One question we asked ourselves was why it was always the men leading chants and making speeches at rallies and demonstrations. We decided it wasn\u2019t that they were unwilling to share, it was that we lacked confidence.</p> <p>So one night, we borrowed a bullhorn [megaphone] and headed down to the beach. We took turns getting a feel for the mechanics, and then we began using the bullhorn to amplify our voices, most of us for the first time ever. The noise of the waves gave us the perfect cover to experiment and let loose. I remember the freedom of standing out on the sand under the dark sky, finding my loudest voice, and letting it fly. I had never been in a situation before where I felt so free to fail and so free to succeed, and that night made me a different kind of woman.</p> <p>After that, the bullhorn was ours. A small battle, perhaps, but one that has come to mind in recent months as I\u2019ve watched so many women speaking from bullhorns and microphones. Who even thinks to notice it now? On such small battles, larger ones are won, and new worlds open up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/08/fighting-for-equality-and-against-catcalling-the-battles-women-have-won\">Fighting for equality and against catcalling \u2013 the battles women have won</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58c0c41de4b0f24dba72322f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-09T02:57:46.586Z\">2.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Empire State building has been lit up in pink to mark the close of IWD on the <strong>US</strong> east coast.

Many hoped the result would be a government committed to tackling some of the deep-rooted issues facing Canadians.</p> <p>As many as 4,000 indigenous women <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/17/missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-in-canada-could-number-4000\">have gone missing or been murdered in Canada in the past three decades.</a> Child care costs in the country <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oecd-child-care-costs-1.3815954\">rank among the highest in the OECD</a>, while a persistent pay gap between men and women have sent the country tumbling from 19<sup>th</sup> to 35<sup>th</sup> place in recent years in the the <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2016/rankings/\">World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender gap</a> rankings. </p> <p>The feminist scorecard offers a means to hold the prime minister to account by tracking annual progress on these issues and others. \u201cWe knew from experience that it\u2019s one thing to say something but words don\u2019t get you very far in the end, you still need to follow it up with concrete action,\u201d said Ravon. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people looking to Canada, so we want to say, what is the distance between the rhetoric and actual policy-making on the ground?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.oxfam.ca/our-work/publications/time-to-turn-feminist-words-into-action\">The first scorecard, </a>released this week, noted that the government has yet to back its \u201cbold feminist rhetoric\u201d with concrete policy and spending decisions. The government has so-far demonstrated solid progress in just one area: Women\u2019s representation and leadership. \u201cYou can\u2019t overstate the importance of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/canada-cabinet-gender-diversity-justin-trudeau\">first gender balanced cabinet in Canadian history,</a>\u201d said Ravon. The government fared worst in the category of jobs, where Oxfam noted that no tangible steps have been taken to address the gender wage gap or ensure living wages for the working poor, the majority of whom are women. </p> <p>Still, the organisation was hopeful that the government would steadily improve its performance on the scorecard in the coming years. \u201cFor the most part we\u2019ve seen good first signs. Things are moving in the right direction,\u201d said Ravon. \u201cAs the Liberal government embarks on the second year of its mandate, it is time to turn feminist words into action.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, First Lady Sophie Gregoire Trudeau caused titters when she called on Canadians to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day by celebrating \u201cthe boys and men in our lives who encourage us to be who we truly are, who treat girls &amp; women with respect, and who aren\u2019t afraid to speak up in front of others\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BRV3rIAA6SO/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Are you ready to ignite change?

The filters allows users to take self-portraits as Kahlo, civil rights activist Rosa Parks, or scientist Marie Curie.</p> <p>But on a day to celebrate international feminism, Snapchat\u2019s filters have raised some eyebrows.</p> <p>The Frida Kahlo filter lightens a user\u2019s skin and eyes and applies bright red lipstick, a floral headdress and braids, and the artist\u2019s signature unibrow. The skin color change is particularly noticeable on faces with darker skin \u2013 as becomes apparent when Kahlo\u2019s own self-portrait is put through the filter.</p> <p>Kahlo, who was of mixed indigenous and European heritage, painted herself with brown skin and dark eyes.

It turns out a that lot factors people assume drive the wage gap actually play a small role. For instance, women\u2019s choices of careers alone <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/what-is-the-gender-pay-gap-and-is-it-real/\">can\u2019t explain their pay disparity</a>.

But that hasn\u2019t meant that every woman in the workforce has been able to take part. Then and now, women have worked in jobs where striking just isn\u2019t an option.</p> <p>There are various reasons for that. In the US, women are <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat08.htm\">more likely</a> than men to work in part-time employment where workers are often considered more \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/opinion/sunday/disposable-workers.html\">disposable</a>\u201d. They are also less likely than men to receive a <a href=\"https://www.icrw.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/precarious-lives.pdf\">pension</a>, more likely than men to live in <a href=\"http://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/how-does-gender-relate-poverty-status\">poverty</a> and more likely to be paid hourly rates that are <a href=\"https://www.icrw.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/precarious-lives.pdf\">below</a>minimum wage. That makes striking risky, and this is before you even get to the astounding amount of unpaid work women do, including caregiver roles where taking a day off can be a matter of life and death.</p> <p>There are other occupations where women make up the majority. Pre-schoolers in America will have a tough time learning today if their teachers, 98% of whom are female, do decide to go on strike. More important though is healthcare \u2013 what would hospitals around the country look like if the 91% of nurses who are female simply didn\u2019t show up?</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/08/women-strike-inequality-poverty\">Read on</a> for a list of professions in which women dominate and for a look at the gender balance at the Guardian.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58c031b2e4b0bd9dcee56b83\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-08T18:38:04.080Z\">6.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Protests in Poland</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/crsdavies/status/839526620239134720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Major demonstration in Warsaw&#39;s Constitution Square.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IWD2017?src=hash\">#IWD2017</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/HLeD4FbCcU\">pic.twitter.com/HLeD4FbCcU</a></p>&mdash; Christian Davies (@crsdavies) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/crsdavies/status/839526620239134720\">March 8, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Women across Poland held demonstrations and marches on Wednesday to demand equal rights and protest violence.

I see the future. I see hope. And I\u2019m inspired because it will be women who lead the future. That is why I am writing to express my unconditional solidarity with the women\u2019s strike on International Women\u2019s Day, March 8.</p> <p>It would be easy for me to say that I am supporting this day of resistance because I have three daughters and I want nothing to stand in their way as they attempt to achieve their goals. I could also say that I am doing this because my wife, Pele \u2014 my best friend and soulmate \u2014 is of Samoan descent and has lived the struggle of being a woman and the daughter of immigrants. But this issue is a lot bigger than my dreams for my own family. It\u2019s about the women across the earth who are suffering: women who are less worried about a glass ceiling than they are about a collapsing floor. It\u2019s about women of color across the earth who live on less than one dollar a day.

But Toyin Saraki <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/13/good-news-gender-inquality-developing-world-education-maternity-women-hillary-clinton\">wrote in December</a> that the long-term trend is toward parity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A reminder that while the status quo is unacceptable, the longer-term trend is pointed towards gender equality. And this trend is global, not simply confined to the western world. Just look at healthcare. Maternal mortality remains a mass killer in the developing world. It may not be as newsworthy as gender-based violence or as stark and immediate as disease or starvation, but it is the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs334/en/\">second biggest killer of women</a> of reproductive age in the developing world. This is changing.</p> <p>Due to a concerted focus not least through the recently concluded UN <a href=\"http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/maternal_health/en/\">Millennium Development Goals</a>, the amount of women dying in childbirth has fallen by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/may/07/maternal-mortality-rate-drops-half-report-who-childbirth-pregnancy\">45% since 1990</a>. A staggering achievement. Gender-based development campaigns aimed at educating women have also pushed aside outmoded approaches to pregnancy and family planning, empowering women to take control of their own welfare in one of the most vulnerable periods of their lives.</p> <p>Improvement is also being made in education. While secondary education remains a critical problem in many developing countries, the challenge of primary school enrolment has virtually been solved. Enrolment rates globally are now on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/04/mdgs-girls-match-boys-primary-school-enrolment\">near parity between boys and girls</a>.</p> <p>And what of the workplace? The top-line figures may be bleak, but there is evidence to suggest slow change is happening. A <a href=\"http://www.noceilings.org/\">study of 70 countries</a>, including many in the developing world, showed that since 1995 the gender wage gap has narrowed from 28% to 20%. The gap is still far too big.

Instead of outright striking and not showing up to work, I am protesting through silence to raise awareness of gender-based inequalities. My protest started at 6am and I will not speak again until 6pm. I came to work wearing the sign in the picture. I work in a male dominated field, so this has been attracting a lot of attention which is good, but also incredibly scary.</p> <p>So far people have mostly ignored the huge sign hanging from my neck, but if anybody starts reading it, I hand them out a card with a short list of reasons to explain why I&#39;m doing this. Sometimes I am met with ridicule, but even then people want to engage and discuss. A couple of times there has been heartfelt support and admitarion.

The day has more significance for ordinary citizens here than it does in the UK - most particularly in eastern parts, where under communism women - almost all of whom had jobs - were feted on this day, with flowers or being given time off work, sometimes even meals or drinks laid on by the boss, etc. Almost 30 years after the collapse of communism, this still happens in some workplaces, though the tradition is dying out. </p> <p>It\u2019s considered important enough that editorials in several leading German newspapers choose focus on it, arguing that recent global developments underline how we need IWD more than ever at a time when women\u2019s rights are so under attack. </p> <p>The liberal S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung from Munich writes: \u201cThe rise of populists in Germany, Russia, Turkey, America, Hungary, France and Poland has changed everything. They have brought back an image of women which we had thought had long been overcome. In Russia domestic violence will in future be treated as a much milder crime than it was previously, despite the fact that every year 12,000 women are battered to death by their partners. We should be under no illusion - despite regional differences, rights are being eroded in a similarly retrograde and discriminatory way. Women\u2019s rights are not collateral damage in the fight for the greater good, they are a barometer, a symptom of the internal state of a society.</p> <p>According to The Leipziger Volkszeitung: \u201cTrump, Putin and Erdogan are currently competing with each other in front of all of us for the position of biggest macho. What should we be doing to counteract this particularly difficult to deal with type of man?...Our motto should be \u2018the world needs strong women\u2019.</p> <p>The Lausitzer Rundschau, from Cottbus (like Leipzig in the former communist east) comments: \u201cthose who wants to change something but trusts in politics to do this, will wait forever. It was never a comfortable thing to fight for rights and freedoms. Dear women, you must become active yourselves, strengthen your networks and stand up together for your common interests. And we men should be your allies in this, and not just on this day.\u201d<br /></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58bffa79e4b0f24dba722e6f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-08T12:36:09.116Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is wonderful footage of the Suffragettes marching on London in 1915 for the right to vote and equal pay from the British Film Insitute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BFI/status/839422967163465728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The fight for women&#39;s rights, 1915: Suffragettes march on London for equal pay and the right to vote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BritainOnFilm?src=hash\">#BritainOnFilm</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/InternationalWomensDay?src=hash\">#InternationalWomensDay</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ICthcuLhJa\">pic.twitter.com/ICthcuLhJa</a></p>&mdash; BFI (@BFI) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BFI/status/839422967163465728\">March 8, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58bff7e2e4b0bd9dcee56a2e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/samjones\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-08T12:25:54.565Z\">12.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">IWD in Spain</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/swajones/status/839416416839303172\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IWD?src=hash\">#IWD</a>, my i/v with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CapdeArguelles\">@CapdeArguelles</a> - Retrieving an untold story: voices of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Spanish?src=hash\">#Spanish</a> female artists finally heard <a href=\"https://t.co/SMUZlHd0il\">https://t.co/SMUZlHd0il</a></p>&mdash; Sam Jones (@swajones) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swajones/status/839416416839303172\">March 8, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Some campaigners have argued that Spain still overlooks the massive contribution that women have made to society, culture and arts.</p> <p>As part of Madrid\u2019s belated efforts to honour some of the women who have been overshadowed by their more famous male peers, the city\u2019s mayor will unveil a plaque today to commemorate the Lyceum Women\u2019s Club, a meeting place for some of the leading intellectuals of pre-civil war Spain.</p> <p>The drive to remember their lives and contributions with plaques is being led by Nuria Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles, a professor of Hispanic and gender studies at the University of Exeter.</p> <p>Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles, and her film-maker collaborator, Tania Ballo, have so far provided the city council with research on more than 15 women, including the journalist, actor, writer and diplomat <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Oyarz%C3%A1bal_Smith\">Isabel Oyarz\u00e1bal</a>, the lawyer and politician <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Kent\">Victoria Kent</a> and the poet <a href=\"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernestina_de_Champourc%C3%ADn\">Ernestina de Champourc\u00edn</a>.<br /></p> <p>\u201cPeople, both Spanish and British, have written about Spain\u2019s ghosts, but the most important ghosts are the women \u2013 the invisible 50%,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/15/voices-of-spanish-women-silenced-by-franco-are-being-heard-once-more\">Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles told the Guardian recently</a>.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe role of history and an awareness of our past is utterly fundamental.

But no \u2026</p> <p>So for the last two International Women\u2019s Days I have tried to highlight this stupidity.

It goes on relentlessly, for hours and hours, but I try to get to them all because to see the same moronic question asked over and over again by people (who don\u2019t even think just to check Google to make sure they\u2019re not making an arse of themselves) is very funny, and shows exactly why an international women\u2019s day is necessary.</p> <p>Incidentally, nobody tweets me back to say: \u201cOh thanks for the information. I was wondering when it was.\u201d Almost like they don\u2019t want to know the answer to their own question.</p> <p>My hope is that if I can spend a day a year dealing with this issue, then that means that everyone else can get on with making International Women\u2019s Day about celebrating women and not complaining about the supposed raw deal men get. So I let men know that they do have a day if they want to celebrate themselves.

They technically went on everything-strike, but since their democratic exclusion was mirrored in the workplace, this functionally meant they stopped looking after their children and doing the washing-up (those who did have jobs worked in schools and nurseries, so those had to close as well). A staggering 90% of women took part, after the genius move of renaming it, not a strike, but a \u201cWomen\u2019s Day Off\u201d, dressing up stridency as me-time. Men had to take their children to work, which gave the event its other name: The Long Friday.</p> <p>This action <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/03/iceland-best-country-women-feminist\">changed the face of Icelandic politics</a>, delivering to Europe its first female president, Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir, five years later. But its significance in the wider feminist landscape is subtler, since that tension of where you situate domestic labour in the fight for equality is, if anything, more pronounced now than it was then. Feminism at home sounds a lot like nagging. The strike was underpinned by a movement, the radical Red Stockings in Iceland, and sister organisations across Europe making the case for paid housework.<br /></p> <p>We now broadly reject domestic responsibilities as innately female, so would struggle to galvanise action around them. Yet we still do most of them (statistically, I mean; I don\u2019t personally, I am a slut) and they are still unpaid. I struggle to see much victory in this turn of events.</p> <p>If you want victory, go to Poland: \u201cThe so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/polish-abortion-law-protesters-march-against-proposed-restrictions\">Black Protest</a> last October,\u201d feminist activist Katarzyna Bielinska tells me, \u201cwas provoked by an attempt to tighten already the extremely restrictive abortion law in Poland by introducing an even more barbarian bill, banning abortion totally, making a woman who aborts liable for five years\u2019 imprisonment, criminalising miscarriage and blocking prenatal foetus investigation and treatment.\u201d Tens of thousands of women went on strike, or \u2013 this detail pleases me \u2013 went to work but dressed in black, and didn\u2019t do anything. More than 140 cities, towns and municipalities were profoundly affected, especially public-sector work.</p> <p>\u201cThe success was huge and unexpected,\u201d Bielinska says. \u201cThe governing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/25/poland-lurches-to-right-with-election-of-law-and-justice-party\">Law and Justice party</a> rejected the bill three days after.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/07/sex-bans-womens-strikes-international-womens-day\">Sex bans, strength and solidarity: women\u2019s strikes through the ages</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-08T07:19:16.431Z\">at 7.19am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58bfac6ce4b00bd41ba4fc1b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-08T07:06:35.709Z\">7.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Today is on course to be one of the most political International Women\u2019s Days in history, Alexandra Topping and Molly Redden report:</p> <blockquote> <p>From <strong>Thailand</strong> to <strong>Poland</strong>, the <strong>United States</strong> to <strong>Australia</strong>, the first <a href=\"http://www.globalwomenstrike.net/\">Global Women\u2019s Strike</a> will see action on both the industrial and domestic fronts, with participants keen to show solidarity with an energised global women\u2019s movement.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWe are united, we are international \u2013 and we are everywhere,\u201d said Klementyna Suchanow, a Poland-based organiser of the Global Women\u2019s Strike, adding that the walkout would put governments and institutions under pressure by giving women a voice that has long been ignored. \u201cWe are an army of women across the globe and we are no longer asking to be listened to.

There is much to celebrate when it comes to progress for women throughout the world. There is also much to lament, both in relation to what still needs to be done and where the gains we have made risk going backwards.</p> <p>Stillbirth, however, is standing still. The incidence of stillbirth is the same today as it has been for decades. Very little money or attention goes into research to reduce or prevent stillbirth.<br /></p> <p>Why? Stillbirth struggles on two fronts.</p> <p>One, stillbirth is a thing that happens inside a woman\u2019s body. In a male-dominated world, stillbirth is easily relegated as a private tragedy rather than as a public health matter.</p> <p>Two, stillbirth is not a cause feminists want to champion. Even though stillbirth is a tragedy for thousands of women each year, most feminists don\u2019t want to talk about the death of a baby inside its mother\u2019s womb. Many feminists get uneasy about anything that gets a bit too close to abortion rights.</p> <p>So let\u2019s be clear: stillbirth happens to women who want to be mothers, who have chosen to take a baby to term. It has nothing to do with abortion. Many mothers of stillborn babies are pro-choice and would not seek to restrict women\u2019s access to abortion services.</p> <p>If feminists believe women\u2019s choices should be respected, then there is nothing to fear from recognising a woman\u2019s choice to be a mother.

This is creating a huge demand for foreign \u2018wives\u2019.</p> <p>We heard devastating stories from women who have returned from China. One told us how she travelled to what she thought was a well-paying job in the north of Myanmar, only to be sold into marriage in China. She was trapped near Beijing for seven years, and had two daughters with her \u2018husband\u2019, only to then be deported by Chinese police to Myanmar. She has not had contact with her daughters since then.</p> <p>Another told us how she was deceived by a friend (who turned out to be a marriage broker) to travel to the border with China. There she was sold to a Chinese man for US$9,300. When she did not become pregnant within seven months, this man sold her to another Chinese man for $11,500. She was trapped in that \u2018marriage\u2019 for three years before her family and Myanmar police managed to secure her release.

If you get pregnant with a third child, abortion is compulsory. But I don\u2019t see our free access to abortion as a sign of progress, as reproductive rights only apply to married women.

We care for our partners (though in a genuine relationship it is certainly not a one-way street). We care for our children. We care for others\u2019 children. We care for our parents as they grow older. And we fill the jobs equated with caring. In my sector, 97% of us are women.<br /></p> <p>It is not because the work we do has no value. It is because the work we do has an intrinsic female association. \u2018Care\u2019 in any role should not be seen as of little value. If anything, it should be seen as value-adding to the role. Look at aged care workers, educators, nurses, teachers, social workers, psychologists, therapists, tutors, doctors. None of these professions are seen only as caring, but care is understood as intrinsic to their role.</p> <p>But it is we in early childhood who forever need to point out that we are the same: we do caring but our whole job is far more than that.</p> <p>I am walking off because I want the government and society to recognise that an early childhood educator is a professional role and one that must be given its deserved status.

It goes on relentlessly, for hours and hours, but I try to get to them all because to see the same moronic question asked over and over again by people (who don\u2019t even think just to check Google to make sure they\u2019re not making an arse of themselves) is very funny, and shows exactly why an international women\u2019s day is necessary.</p> <p>Incidentally, nobody tweets me back to say: \u201cOh thanks for the information. I was wondering when it was.\u201d Almost like they don\u2019t want to know the answer to their own question.</p> <p>My hope is that if I can spend a day a year dealing with this issue, then that means that everyone else can get on with making International Women\u2019s Day about celebrating women and not complaining about the supposed raw deal men get. So I let men know that they do have a day if they want to celebrate themselves.

If you\u2019re one of our readers in the US, you can sign up for our freshly launched newsletter tracking the progress of the resistance on feminism and beyond. Or join the Guardian US Facebook community. To keep up with the week in patriarchy, you can sign up for Jessica Valenti\u2019s email roundup and read Laura Bates on everyday sexism. Globally, track news on women\u2019s rights and gender equality, and feminism. Knit a pussy hat. Tell us how you marked IWD and what you\u2019ll be doing next. Speak. Thank you for your comments and contributions. A late entrant for most uncomfortable attempt to use IWD for unrelated political point-scoring comes from the US House Ways and Means committee, where representatives are debating the proposed changes to healthcare provisions. Missouri\u2019s Republican congressman, Jason Smith, is concerned that women are \u2013 under Obamacare \u2013 paying tax on their visits to tanning salons. Why is nobody talking about this on International Women\u2019s Day, he wanted to know. (I\u2019m not sure he genuinely wanted to know, but he did say it.) Washington Democrat congresswoman Suzan DelBene thought women might have more pressing concerns when it came to healthcare: birth control, for one. Ahead of International Women\u2019s Day, we asked readers to share stories about the battles you\u2019ve won. You can read them all here, and here is just one example of the responses we received: Brenda Carter, El Cerrito, California In 1969, I was a college student and part of a hippy-communist collective. We put out a monthly newspaper and ran a bookstore in deepest, darkest conservative Orange County. We all worked together, but there were plenty of gender assumptions at play. I refused to learn to make coffee or type so that I couldn\u2019t be stuck with those mundane tasks. The women in the group met in a consciousness-raising group. One question we asked ourselves was why it was always the men leading chants and making speeches at rallies and demonstrations. We decided it wasn\u2019t that they were unwilling to share, it was that we lacked confidence. So one night, we borrowed a bullhorn [megaphone] and headed down to the beach. We took turns getting a feel for the mechanics, and then we began using the bullhorn to amplify our voices, most of us for the first time ever. The noise of the waves gave us the perfect cover to experiment and let loose. I remember the freedom of standing out on the sand under the dark sky, finding my loudest voice, and letting it fly. I had never been in a situation before where I felt so free to fail and so free to succeed, and that night made me a different kind of woman. After that, the bullhorn was ours. A small battle, perhaps, but one that has come to mind in recent months as I\u2019ve watched so many women speaking from bullhorns and microphones. Who even thinks to notice it now? On such small battles, larger ones are won, and new worlds open up. The Empire State building has been lit up in pink to mark the close of IWD on the US east coast. (The women\u2019s march has done a pretty solid job of reclaiming pink as a protest colour.) To mark International Women\u2019s Day in Brazil, football team Cruzeiro tonight wore specially commissioned squad numbers with messages to highlight daily challenges faced by women in the South American country. Cruizero won their Brazilian Cup match against Murici-AL 2-0. The shirts featured a different message for each number such as \u201ca rape every 11 minutes\u201d or \u201csalaries 30% lower\u201d, organised in conjunction with the NGO AzMina, which fights for female empowerment in Brazil. Announcing the initiative on their website on Wednesday, the Belo Horizonte-based club\u2019s president Gilvan de Pinho Tavares said: In the 21st century, it is not tolerable to see women suffer acts of violence and discrimination. With this action, we join all who combat inequalities against people of the feminine sex. This is one of the social roles that big fan clubs must always be developing. International Women\u2019s Day is not just a moment to bring to the surface all the characteristics of inequality that still exist in Brazil and the world, but it is also a moment of awareness of other aspects related to women. It\u2019s important to have a moment of this, where you can bring up such important and women-related issues. It\u2019s getting loud in Los Angeles: Reuters has spoken to some of the women who took part in protests in the US today: Debra Sands, a middle-school teacher, joined thousands of women at New York City\u2019s Central Park after her students convinced her to attend. \u201cThis past year\u2019s election made me realize that voting in November isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Sands said. In San Francisco, where about 1,500 people gathered, Christine Bussenius said she and her female colleagues at Grey Advertising convinced their all-male managers to give them the day off and participate in the rally. \u201cWe were nervous,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut the men stepped up to fill in the void.\u201d Rallies were held in numerous cities, including Washington, where demonstrators gathered at the US labor department. Female staffers at Fusion Media Group\u2019s Gizmodo declared they were striking for the day. At least three US school districts, in Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina, closed because of staff shortages after teachers requested the day off. Nearly 1,000 women converged outside Los Angeles City Hall, many of them critical of the Republican-backed healthcare bill that would strip women\u2019s health and abortion provider Planned Parenthood of funding. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s anti-woman,\u201d said Kassia Krozsur, a finance professional. About 200 gathered in Atlanta, where signs read \u201cWe are sisters\u201d and \u201cStop Trump.\u201d \u201cIf we want to change what is going on, we need to turn anger into action. People need to run for local office,\u201d organizer Rebekah Joy said. Pakistan Macedonia Yemen Lebanon Egypt In the US, Time reports that several women\u2019s march organisers who were arrested earlier on Wednesday in New York have now been released. Organisers Tamika Mallory, Linda Sarsour, Carmen Perez and Bob Bland were among a number of protesters detained close to the Trump Hotel at Columbus Circle. Most \u2013 including Mallory, Sarsour and Perez \u2013 were freed on Wednesday evening, Time reported, but others remain in custody: Yet to be released by 8pm on Wednesday was Sophie Ellman-Golan, a 24-year old activist whose mother Rabbi Barat Ellman was arrested about three weeks ago for protesting the Trump\u2019s travel ban. \u201cI\u2019m incredible proud of her,\u201d said Ellman as she waited outside the precinct for her daughter to be released. \u201cFor a long time she\u2019s been a woman who puts her feet where her mouth is.\u201d The ONE campaign, an international organization aimed at ending extreme poverty and eradicating preventable diseases, staged several hundred walk-ins around the globe earlier today to rally for women\u2019s education. One of its largest events took place in Nigeria, in Ekiti State, with several hundred students and activists. In the western part of the country, dozens holding signs to protest the worldwide gender disparity in education marched and blocked traffic on a 5km march starting at the University of Ibadan. Feminists across the Americas have been holding a day-long live marathon of radio programming \u2013 due to come to an end at 10pm Argentina time, in around half an hour from now. The #MaratonaRadialFeminista has featured women and their stories from Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Canada, Nicaragua, Mexico and Uruguay \u2013 with European solidarity from Spain and Switzerland \u2013 on Red Nosotras Radio. Organisers say: The sorority and joy of being together, without losing our anger, will once again break the frontiers. France\u2019s president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has lambasted what he called a decline in women\u2019s rights in the United States and Russia. AFP reports: Speaking on International Women\u2019s Day, the French leader said that \u201cthreats of backtracking\u201d on women\u2019s rights don\u2019t just come from \u201cemerging nations or countries under dictatorships, but also in developed and rich countries\u201d. \u201cWhat about positions or intentions expressed by the new US administration?\u201d he asked. They would \u201creduce funding for family planning, as if this is the first cut to be made to allow an increase in military spending\u201d, he added. Hollande also took aim at Moscow\u2019s policies, pointing out that a law that penalised violence against family members had recently been modified. \u201cWhy would anyone change this text except to once again attack the freedom of women?\u201d he said. Hollande, who is coming to the end of his tenure and not standing for re-election, added that in Poland there had recently been protests against attempts to impose a near total ban on abortions. Such moves to row back on women\u2019s rights stem from \u201creligious fundamentalism\u201d and \u201cthe resurgence of reactionary ideologies which intend to reassign women to the procreative role in the domestic sphere\u201d, he said. Women have been marching in Buenos Aires, Argentina; reader Ella Jessel, who is there, has shared this video and images with me. (You can send your own contributions, from wherever you are marking IWD, to me on Twitter @Claire_Phipps.) Last October, tens of thousands of women marched in Buenos Aires to push back against violence against women. The hashtag #NiUnaMenos (\u201cNot one less\u201d, meaning not one more woman lost to male violence) has become a powerful rallying cry for women in Argentina and other South American countries. Tens of thousands of women took to the streets across Turkey earlier on Wednesday, AFP reports: In Istanbul over 10,000 people, mostly women, walked the long Istiklal Avenue, chanting \u201cend male-perpetrated violence\u201d and \u201cTayyip, Tayyip, run, run, we are coming\u201d. \u201cTayyip\u201d refers to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is seeking to create an executive presidency that would see the post of prime minister abolished. On 16 April, the Turkish public will vote on whether to change the current system, which the government argues causes instability \u2013 while critics claim greater powers for Erdogan will lead to one-man rule. A deep purple dominated the colourful crowds in Istanbul who held placards saying \u201cwomen are free\u201d and \u201cwe are strong united\u201d. The march was organised by multiple women\u2019s rights groups and attendees included LGBT individuals, young women, students and also men \u2013 many of whom were carrying \u201cNo\u201d posters. For Nurten Karanci who attended the march, being a woman in Turkey means a \u201cfight to live, to survive\u201d. Last year, a woman was attacked in Istanbul for wearing shorts on a public bus while another woman wearing a headscarf said she was kicked and insulted last month. Women\u2019s activists often call for an end to violence against women in a country where hundreds of women are killed every year, often by their husbands. Despite a heavy police presence and water cannon trucks on standby, the Istanbul march took place peacefully as they walked from Taksim Square to Sishane on the other end of the avenue on the European side of Istanbul. Members of the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP), whose two co-leaders remain under arrest accused of terror links, also took part of the march in Istanbul. Meanwhile in Ankara women hit tambourines and held \u201cNo\u201d posters shouting their opposition to giving \u201cone man\u201d all the power. In the Kurdish-majority southeastern city of Diyarbakir, hundreds of people staged a demonstration for women\u2019s rights, dancing and playing music. One participant, Sabiba Akgul, said all women \u201cshould stand up and support each other. Hand in hand, they will find freedom.\u201d Activist Ozlem Gul in Istanbul described the difficulty of being a woman in Turkey: Being a woman anyhow is very complicated, especially today. We have to fight against many things. We have to fight against the attacks on our bodies, our work, our opinions. We are in the streets, we won\u2019t let up, and we will keep on the fight as Turkish women. In Australia, the feminist and author Germaine Greer has said that aiming for equality is a \u201cprofoundly conservative goal\u201d for women, speaking at the launch of her archive at the University of Melbourne on Wednesday night. Greer told an audience of about 500 people at the Kathleen Fitzpatrick Theatre for the International Women\u2019s Day event: What everybody has accepted is the idea of equality feminism. It will change nothing. War is made against civilian populations where women and children are the principal casualties in places like Syria, whether in collapsing buildings or bombed schools. War is now completely made by the rich with their extraordinary killing machines, killing the poor who have no comeback. Women are drawing level with men in this profoundly destructive world that we live in and, as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s the wrong way. We\u2019re getting nowhere. If we\u2019re going to change things I think we\u2019re going to have to start creating a women\u2019s polity that is strong, that has its own way of operating, that makes contact with women in places like Syria, and that challenges the right of destructive nations. Women needed to aim higher and achieve more than simply drawing level with men and entering into traditionally male-dominated fields, Greer said: If what happens when women discover when they join the army is they discover it\u2019s no place for a sane human being then they\u2019ve learned something. But right now, things are looking distinctly grim. In Brazil, a message from President Michel Temer to mark IWD has been met with some incredulity, as he praised women for their home-making skills and ability to spot a supermarket bargain: Temer does not have great form: on taking over as president last year, he installed a new cabinet with zero women in it. Women marching in Brazilian cities today expressed anger towards Temer, as my colleague Jonathan Watts reports: Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasilia and Porto Alegre each saw hundreds of demonstrators mark International Women\u2019s Day with banners and chants of Fora Temer! (Michel Temer Out!), a reference to the current president who came to power by plotting the impeachment of Brazil\u2019s first woman president \u2013 and his former running mate \u2013 Dilma Rousseff. The conservative president did little to mollify their anger with a speech in which he lauded how much women do around the house and the important role they play in assessing supermarket prices. He also noted that more an economic recovery will enable more women to enter the workplace in addition to their \u201cdomestic chores.\u201d On taking power last year, Temer abolished the ministry of women, racial equality and human rights, and cut programs on gender equality. His 28-member cabinet now includes only two women. Critics say his pension reform plans will hit women harder than men. Hi, this is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog, with thanks to Molly. I\u2019ll continue to cover IWD events live as they happen, everywhere in the globe it\u2019s still 8 March. Do send me your contributions from wherever you are, on Twitter @Claire_Phipps or in the comments below. Here\u2019s a female role model if ever we saw (or read) one: Matilda sees something she likes in Wall St\u2019s Fearless Girl: The Fearless Girl statue appeared overnight just down the road from Wall Street, defiantly staring down the famous bronze bull. The statue of a young girl, hands on hips, was instantly providing a good PR story for investment company State Street Global Advisors, who installed the statue for International Women\u2019s Day and called on companies to put more women on their boards. But it also provided a nice background for New York journalists in search of an International Women\u2019s Day story. The Guardian was asked by two separate news organizations for interviews when it popped down to visit, with Buzzfeed livestreaming the statue on its site. Thanks to the bull, that corner of Broadway is always pumping with tourists, but Fearless Girl made the crowds even worse than normal. Even if it was just a clever marketing stunt, these girls didn\u2019t care. At least 100 people marched in downtown Washington, DC to demand equal pay and protections for women workers. Activists marched to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day and protest violence against women in San Salvador. Hundreds took part in an International Women\u2019s Day rally at Candelaria square in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Guardian correspondent Jon Watts reports: At a demonstration in central Rio de Janeiro, several hundred women protested against sexual violence, unequal wages and the current government of President Michel Temer, who ousted his female running mate Dilma Rousseff last year. \u201cTemer is a coup monger and a misogynist,\u201d said student Kharine Dantes. \u201cHe wants to repeal quotas for women parliamentarians and to outlaw the morning-after pill.\u201d Outside the City council building in Rio de Janeiro, Workers Party activists handed out black balloons each marked with a different statistic about violence against women in Brazil: a rape every two hours, three-fifths of young women suffering violence from their partners and 40% of police women tend victims of sexual harassment. \u201cThis is a day of struggle as well as celebration,\u201d said Micaela Costa. \u201cThe problem of violence and harassment is terrible but at least it is becoming more visible.\u201d Dozens of women gathered in Lafayette Square in front of the White House to protest a US policy that bans international NGOs from providing abortion services or offering information about abortions if they receive US funding. President Trump imposed what critics call the \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d in an executive order he signed just after taking office. The policy has put thousands of international healthcare workers in a difficult position; they must decide whether to continue to offer family planning care that includes abortion or to preserve a critical funding stream. The US is the single largest donor to global health efforts. But many international health advocates insist that their efforts are not comprehensive without abortion services. Worldwide, unsafe abortions are a major cause of maternal mortality and kill tens of thousands of women every year. Oops. Despite being a self-declared feminist with a gender balanced cabinet, Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government have fallen short when it comes to translating rhetoric into real change for the country\u2019s women, according to a new \u201cfeminist scorecard\u201d from Oxfam Canada. Many in the country were hopeful when the prime minister publicly proclaimed himself a feminist after being elected in 2015, said Lauren Ravon of Oxfam. Many hoped the result would be a government committed to tackling some of the deep-rooted issues facing Canadians. As many as 4,000 indigenous women have gone missing or been murdered in Canada in the past three decades. Child care costs in the country rank among the highest in the OECD, while a persistent pay gap between men and women have sent the country tumbling from 19th to 35th place in recent years in the the World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender gap rankings. The feminist scorecard offers a means to hold the prime minister to account by tracking annual progress on these issues and others. \u201cWe knew from experience that it\u2019s one thing to say something but words don\u2019t get you very far in the end, you still need to follow it up with concrete action,\u201d said Ravon. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people looking to Canada, so we want to say, what is the distance between the rhetoric and actual policy-making on the ground?\u201d The first scorecard, released this week, noted that the government has yet to back its \u201cbold feminist rhetoric\u201d with concrete policy and spending decisions. The government has so-far demonstrated solid progress in just one area: Women\u2019s representation and leadership. \u201cYou can\u2019t overstate the importance of the first gender balanced cabinet in Canadian history,\u201d said Ravon. The government fared worst in the category of jobs, where Oxfam noted that no tangible steps have been taken to address the gender wage gap or ensure living wages for the working poor, the majority of whom are women. Still, the organisation was hopeful that the government would steadily improve its performance on the scorecard in the coming years. \u201cFor the most part we\u2019ve seen good first signs. Things are moving in the right direction,\u201d said Ravon. \u201cAs the Liberal government embarks on the second year of its mandate, it is time to turn feminist words into action.\u201d Meanwhile, First Lady Sophie Gregoire Trudeau caused titters when she called on Canadians to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day by celebrating \u201cthe boys and men in our lives who encourage us to be who we truly are, who treat girls &amp; women with respect, and who aren\u2019t afraid to speak up in front of others\u201d. Many US female journalists are in a tricky spot today: should they go on strike in solidarity or work to cover women focused stories that otherwise would be ignored? Different media outlets, particularly women-focused ones, are trying out different methods. Bustle is on strike. MTV adjusted its logo to make it a W for women. Glamour colored its logo red in solidarity with the women\u2019s strike, and all its coverage is focused on International Women\u2019s Day and the strike. New York Magazine\u2019s The Cut is on strike, \u201cto show solidarity with the women around the world who are standing up for equal pay and equal opportunity, reproductive freedom, an end to sexual assaults, an end to bigotry of all kinds, and policies that support our families like parental leave, health care, and child care.\u201d Teen Vogue is also striking: Although as an editorial staff we are privileged to have this platform and audience (as well as the opportunity to take a day off of work), journalism is still an industry that disproportionately awards leadership and power to men, and as a result, we still struggle to be taken seriously when we talk about politics. Jezebel is letting male colleagues take over the site for the day, and it\u2019s proving to be the most fascinating media experiment of the day. As editor-in-chief Emma Carmichael wrote: Publishing for a majority women audience is quite different from publishing for Deadspin or Gizmodo, and we want them to be thoughtful about how they package news and write criticism for Jezebel on a politically meaningful day for many women around the world. We\u2019re asking them to take that responsibility on without much of our guidance and advice, and if they stumble in that pursuit, we hope you notice. A few of our brave volunteers have confessed to being a bit nervous about this experiment, and we agree that they should be. If the site feels different or off or even just \u201cbad\u201d tomorrow, that is very much the point. It\u2019s been\u2026interesting. The first post of the day was a somewhat self-congratulatory entry by Jim Cooke about feminists using an illustration he created. Another post is titled \u201cSo Now There\u2019s a Girl on Wall Street\u201d. Hamilton Nolan wrote about the left-wing woke men who describe themselves as \u201callies\u201d while actually being insufferable creeps. Here at The Guardian, our female staffers are working, but I\u2019ve got my own personal strike motto So far so good! More than a 100 women arrived today in Mexico City\u2019s Historic Center, known as Zocalo, to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day. By mid-day, a fair organized by the Women\u2019s Institute of Mexico City had garnered almost 80 civil organizations and government initiatives to promote awareness on safety. \u201cSince 2015, Mexico City is part of the global initiative for the provision of safe cities and public spaces for women,\u201d InMujeres General Director Teresa Inchaustegui told The Guardian. \u201cThis is a topic very important for females particularly young ones who suffer the most.\u201d Inchaustegui said the local government is supporting women who will join the international labor strike and march scheduled to take place at 4pm next to the Angel of Independence in Reforma. Several groups of activists including Ni una menos movement, female members of the Workers Union and the Citizen Assembly for the Rights of Women are expected to join the demands against gender violence and inequality. \u201cWe will strike because we are fed up of violence,\u201d Areli Castillo said. One of the founders of the Citizen Assembly, Castillo criticized the government\u2019s festival partly because \u201cthey see it as a party, to congratulate women but don\u2019t need compliments, we need recognition.\u201d Melissa Cuevas, 31, is preparing to attend the march this afternoon as she sees it as \u201ca way to increase awareness among the population.\u201d Cuevas attributes gender inequality to \u201ca strong patriarchal approach in the society which consider that women are inferior, and based on this belief different problems arise, but the belief behind it is the main cause of it.\u201d In most parts of Mexico City, the day continues under the notion business as usual. Female entrepreneur Maria del Mar Gargari said \u201cI won\u2019t participate because I have a small business and cannot leave it unattended.\u201d According to statistics from the National Citizen Observatory of Femicides, seven Mexican women are killed everyday because of gender-based violence. Several hundred protesters have descended on the Utah state capitol for A Day Without a Woman protest. The AP reports: Hundreds of women dressed in red and holding signs with photos of their local lawmakers are gathering at the Utah state capitol for a Day Without a Woman protest to remind legislators they\u2019re closely watching how they handle women\u2019s issues. Crowds of women stood outside both the state\u2019s House and Senate on Wednesday to send notes to lawmakers asking them to come out to talk with them. Salt Lake City resident Chelsi Archibald says she skipped work at her marketing job to attend the event and send a note to Republican Sen. Todd Weiler, urging his support of the Equal Rights Amendment. International Women\u2019s Day protests are still happening sporadically across the US. In New York, at least 10 organizers were arrested by the NYPD, said a spokeswoman for the event. In Washington, DC, dozens of protesters marched on the Department of Labor demanding equal pay. And on TV, the revolution was color-coordinated. Snapchat is celebrating Mexican artist Frida Kahlo on International Women\u2019s Day with a filter that lightens the skin of users. Snapchat debuted three custom filters for the day, which is being marked in the United States with protests and strikes. The filters allows users to take self-portraits as Kahlo, civil rights activist Rosa Parks, or scientist Marie Curie. But on a day to celebrate international feminism, Snapchat\u2019s filters have raised some eyebrows. The Frida Kahlo filter lightens a user\u2019s skin and eyes and applies bright red lipstick, a floral headdress and braids, and the artist\u2019s signature unibrow. The skin color change is particularly noticeable on faces with darker skin \u2013 as becomes apparent when Kahlo\u2019s own self-portrait is put through the filter. Kahlo, who was of mixed indigenous and European heritage, painted herself with brown skin and dark eyes. Much of her work engaged with indigenous themes and imagery. The filter for Nobel Prize-winning physicist and chemist applies smoky eye makeup and lengthens the eye lashes. Curie is best known for her groundbreaking research on radioactivity. She was awarded the Nobel Prize twice, once for chemistry and once for physics. For International Women\u2019s Day, the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, is sharing some facts about the persistent wage gap in the United States. A lot of EPI\u2019s output has focused on which factors do not explain the wage gap. It turns out a that lot factors people assume drive the wage gap actually play a small role. For instance, women\u2019s choices of careers alone can\u2019t explain their pay disparity. And women can\u2019t simply educate themselves out of the pay gap. Women who hold advanced degrees still earn less, on average, than men with only a bachelor\u2019s degree. Then, there\u2019s the one-two punch of gender and racial bias. In the US, the wage gap is much bigger if you\u2019re a woman of color. In fact, while the overall wage gap has narrowed over the past four decades, the disparity between white women\u2019s wages and black women\u2019s is one of the fastest-growing gaps in the economy. That gap has increased the most for college-educated black women who are just entering the market. Latina women are even further behind when their wages are compared alongside white workers\u2019. For every dollar a white man is paid, white women are paid 81 cents, black women 65 cents, and Hispanic women 58 cents. Women have made forward progress in gaining managerial roles, but those gains have almost all gone to white women. Meanwhile, the minimum wage workers who have seen their wages freeze are more likely to be women of color. Women are nearly two-thirds of the minimum wage workforce, and the majority of women earning minimum wage or less are women of color. Hundreds of women farmers across Brazil occupied government offices in protest of new policies they say disproportionately harm poor, rural women. In one instance of protest, women from Brazil\u2019s Landless Workers Movement staged an occupation of an abandoned farm belonging to a prominent businessman jailed on charges of corruption. The land, said Ani Hao, a national organizer, belongs to Eike Batista, an oil and gas magnate who was arrested in the course of a multimillion dollar money laundering investigation. One hundred families will camp and farm on its 3,000 hectares, said Hao. Their occupation came as hundreds protesters marched across Brazilian cities or took over public offices. The demonstrators said pension reforms and other changes to social security will make it harder for family farmers to stay on the land. from Reuters: Brazilian officials say the changes, including raising the minimum retirement age for rural workers to 65 years and higher pension contributions, are crucial for South America\u2019s largest country to escape a fiscal crisis and recession. \u201cRural workers live on the margins,\u201d said Sejane Alexandre, a protester in Tocantins State in central Brazil\u2019s agricultural belt. \u201cThe rural worker does not have the same longevity and access to healthcare (as urban employees),\u201d she said, according to local media. In Recife, on Brazil\u2019s northeastern coast, around 1,000 female land rights activists occupied the government\u2019s social security office, the Pastoral Land Commission campaign group said in a statement. About seventy percent of the food consumed by Brazilians is produced by family farmers, according to the United Nations, but small producers often complain about unequal land distribution and poor government services in rural areas. First Lady Melania Trump celebrated International Women\u2019s Day with salsify and spinach gnocchi at a private luncheon at the White House. Guests included Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, Ivanka Trump, Karen Pence, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Sen. Susan Collins, Small Business Administration chair-slash-former WWE executive Linda McMahon, and a 2015 Viognier from Sonoma County. Mona Chalabi writes for the Guardian that not all women can strike today \u2013 some, because they lack the power, and some, because the work can\u2019t happen without them: International Women\u2019s Day has always been tied to labor rights (first by the Socialist Party of America in 1908, and later by female textile workers in Russia in 1917). But that hasn\u2019t meant that every woman in the workforce has been able to take part. Then and now, women have worked in jobs where striking just isn\u2019t an option. There are various reasons for that. In the US, women are more likely than men to work in part-time employment where workers are often considered more \u201cdisposable\u201d. They are also less likely than men to receive a pension, more likely than men to live in poverty and more likely to be paid hourly rates that are belowminimum wage. That makes striking risky, and this is before you even get to the astounding amount of unpaid work women do, including caregiver roles where taking a day off can be a matter of life and death. There are other occupations where women make up the majority. Pre-schoolers in America will have a tough time learning today if their teachers, 98% of whom are female, do decide to go on strike. More important though is healthcare \u2013 what would hospitals around the country look like if the 91% of nurses who are female simply didn\u2019t show up? Read on for a list of professions in which women dominate and for a look at the gender balance at the Guardian. Women across Poland held demonstrations and marches on Wednesday to demand equal rights and protest violence. In Warsaw, hundred gathered before the office of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland\u2019s conservative party and a supporter of the government\u2019s recent efforts to ban abortion. A group of US Democratic congresswomen spoke before a crowd of dozens dressed in red on the steps of the US Capitol. The rally was part of a symbolic walkout some Democrats in the House staged for #DayWithoutAWoman \u2013 a protest the speakers linked directly to Trump and the GOP. \u201cWe are resisting Trump and congressional Republicans and letting them know we will not go back,\u201d said Rep. Barbara Lee of California. \u201cWe walked out today for A Day Without a Woman to send a clear message: that we stand with our sisters across the country who have walked out in defense of equal rights for women\u2026We are raising our voices for the millions of women who can\u2019t.\u201d Amid signs reading \u201cWomen\u2019s Rights are Human Rights,\u201d Lee hailed women of color who \u201cwork twice as hard for half the pay\u201d. Her colleagues denounced the high rates of violence facing trans women, and the renewed threat of deportation facing many immigrants. Rep. Brenda Lawrence of Michigan read out a list of statistics that would reflect a day without women. \u201cA day without a woman is a day of great loss for America and for the world,\u201d she said. \u201cA day without a woman is a day without the primary or sole earner for 40% of households\u201d with young children. \u201cA day without a woman is a day without 47% of the nation\u2019s workforce. A day without a woman is a day without 80% of the health care workforce in America\u201d and \u201cclose to 80% of the elementary and middle school educators in this country.\u201d \u201cYou would think our numbers would be enough to convince people of the needs for equality for women in America,\u201d she concluded. \u201cBut we still have a long way to go.\u201d The White House office of the Press Secretary released the following statement to mark International Women\u2019s Day. International Women\u2019s Day gives us the opportunity to celebrate and reflect upon the meaningful progress women have made throughout society, while also acknowledging that there is still much work that remains to be done to ensure the complete and consequential participation of women in all spheres of economic, political, and public life. Throughout our history, women have made enormous contributions in the service of our country, and we know that as a Nation, America will only become stronger, more prosperous, and better able to meet our shared goals, as women achieve greater access to a level playing field. The United States, as a beacon of hope and a leader in promoting women\u2019s rights, is deeply committed to empowering women both at home and abroad. Our policies will work to advance the economic empowerment of women by promoting entrepreneurship and equal access to education, employment opportunities, and training adapted to a new economic landscape. Together, America looks forward to a bright future with women in higher-wage jobs throughout high-growth sectors. America remains committed to empowering women around the world to realize their full potential within the global marketplace. And with our international partners, America will build upon the legacy of previous generations of women who have bravely broken through both economic and political barriers. It was with these goals in mind that, as one of its first initiatives, this Administration ramped up efforts to promote women in business by launching the United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. The United States will continue to work with Canada and other partners around the globe to ensure that all women have the opportunity to succeed. Today, the United States renews its commitment to fostering economic growth and job creation by harnessing the full potential of women in our economy. This Administration will work diligently to encourage women to enter and succeed in the workforce while addressing the many barriers women still face in achieving economic success, including those that impede women\u2019s access to capital, markets, and networking opportunities. Just as the statement went live, dozens of House Democrats stood on the steps of the US Capitol to argue the threat the Trump administration posed to women\u2019s reproductive rights, women of color, Muslim women, trans women, minimum wage-earners, and women immigrants. Here\u2019s an aerial shot of the protest in New York: Hundreds have started to gather at the southeast corner of Central Park in New York City as part of the US strike for women\u2019s rights. The rally, for women\u2019s economic equality and freedom from violence will culminate in a march, all taking place in the immediate vicinity of Trump Tower. Organizers of International Women\u2019s Day called for a general strike of US women to represent \u201cthe women who have been left behind\u201d, such as women of color, Muslim women, trans women, and working-class women. \u201cEspecially surrounding Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, there\u2019s been this idea that feminism is somehow about women becoming powerful and successful CEOs,\u201d aid Tithi Bhattacharya, an associate professor at Purdue University and one of the people who first called for the strike in a February op-ed for the Guardian. \u201cThe goal of 8 March is to make feminism a threat to the system and to talk about the feminism about the 99% rather than the 1%.\u201d Watch a livestream of US House Democrats staging a walkout to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Chirlane McCray, the first lady of New York City, marks International Women\u2019s Day: In the US, Michael Bennett of the NFL\u2019s Seattle Seahawks pledged his \u201cunconditional solidarity with the women\u2019s strike on International Women\u2019s Day\u201d: As a black man in America, I sometimes get overwhelmed and discouraged by what I see \u2014 from the police killings of unarmed black men, to the unequal educational system, to the mass incarceration of poor people of color in for-profit prisons. But when I look in my daughters\u2019 eyes, I see the courage of Harriet Tubman, the patience of Rosa Parks, the soul of Ida B. Wells, the passion of Fannie Lou Hamer and the heart of Angela Davis. I see the future. I see hope. And I\u2019m inspired because it will be women who lead the future. That is why I am writing to express my unconditional solidarity with the women\u2019s strike on International Women\u2019s Day, March 8. It would be easy for me to say that I am supporting this day of resistance because I have three daughters and I want nothing to stand in their way as they attempt to achieve their goals. I could also say that I am doing this because my wife, Pele \u2014 my best friend and soulmate \u2014 is of Samoan descent and has lived the struggle of being a woman and the daughter of immigrants. But this issue is a lot bigger than my dreams for my own family. It\u2019s about the women across the earth who are suffering: women who are less worried about a glass ceiling than they are about a collapsing floor. It\u2019s about women of color across the earth who live on less than one dollar a day. It\u2019s about all women who are subject to sexual assault and violence.

Worldwide, the gender gap \u2013 which includes employment, education, and earnings \u2013 actually got worse in 2016, according to the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Report. But Toyin Saraki wrote in December that the long-term trend is toward parity: A reminder that while the status quo is unacceptable, the longer-term trend is pointed towards gender equality. And this trend is global, not simply confined to the western world. Just look at healthcare. Maternal mortality remains a mass killer in the developing world. It may not be as newsworthy as gender-based violence or as stark and immediate as disease or starvation, but it is the second biggest killer of women of reproductive age in the developing world. This is changing. Due to a concerted focus not least through the recently concluded UN Millennium Development Goals, the amount of women dying in childbirth has fallen by 45% since 1990. A staggering achievement. Gender-based development campaigns aimed at educating women have also pushed aside outmoded approaches to pregnancy and family planning, empowering women to take control of their own welfare in one of the most vulnerable periods of their lives. Improvement is also being made in education. While secondary education remains a critical problem in many developing countries, the challenge of primary school enrolment has virtually been solved. Enrolment rates globally are now on a near parity between boys and girls. And what of the workplace? The top-line figures may be bleak, but there is evidence to suggest slow change is happening. A study of 70 countries, including many in the developing world, showed that since 1995 the gender wage gap has narrowed from 28% to 20%. The gap is still far too big. But it is falling. The proportion of women not having children before the menopause has reached a record high in the last decade. In this video, women from the UK, France and Spain discuss the taboo of childlessness that they say comes from a dated societal structure, and mark International Women\u2019s Day by spotlighting female identity beyond motherhood. The tiny Balkan state of Montenegro saw hundreds protest state cuts to maternal aid. The AP reports: Showing support on the International Women\u2019s Day, hundreds have joined a protest by women in tiny Montenegro against cuts in state aid for mothers of three or more children. Financial help for some 21,500 women in Montenegro - a country of 620,000 people - has been slashed by 25 percent amid efforts to tighten public spending. About half of the women on the list are jobless. Montenegrin women have been protesting for days demanding that the government decision be reversed. Protesters on Wednesday blocked traffic outside the parliament building in downtown Podgorica, the capital, shouting \u201cthieves.\u201d Montenegro\u2019s economy has been weak despite recent progress in the Balkan country\u2019s efforts at joining NATO and the European Union. The European Parliament\u2019s Greek vice president, Dimitris Papadimoulis, greeted International Women\u2019s Day with a shocking forecast from the World Economic Forum. \u201cThe World Economic Forum predicts that the gender gap won\u2019t close entirely until 2186,\u201d Papadimoulis told the parliament in a speech replayed on Greek media. \u201cYes, you heard well, until 2186. Only in 169 years! It is more than obvious that we have to speed up this process. We have to act now.\u201d Greek women have suffered the country\u2019s ongoing economic crisis disproportionately. Although seven years of economic meltdown have narrowed a gap in the employment rate between men and women \u2013 because of soaring unemployment rates among men, not an increase in the hiring of women \u2013 Greece\u2019s employment gender gap remains well above the European Union average. In 2015, the gap was 18 percentage points in Greece, compared with 11 across the rest of the EU. In a Facebook post to mark International Women\u2019s Day, Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s leftist prime minister and leader of the Syriza political party, hailed the women worldwide who \u201cbattle for equality, justice and dignity.\u201d He singled out Nadia Murrad, a former ISIS sex slave who is now a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations. Women from more than 40 countries are staging a strike from all work, paid and unpaid, to highlight women\u2019s power within global economies. But what if you can\u2019t join them? Here are other ways you can show solidarity, from wearing red to avoiding the shops for the day. A Guardian reader shares her International Women\u2019s Day protest from Switzerland: On the eve of International Women\u2019s Day, a viral video of a teacher appearing to brag to his class about domestic abuse illustrated just how pervasive Mexico\u2019s machismo culture remains. The footage showed Ram\u00f3n Urrea Bernal, a teacher at a public high school in Guadalajara, affirming that if his wife didn\u2019t consent to sex he\u2019d \u201cgrab her by the hair, give her a fucking beating [and say] \u2018Hey stupid, if you don\u2019t know how to do anything else at least open your legs.\u2019\u201d The coarse, 90-second rant concluded with Urrea declaring that he\u2019d throw his wife and children out on the street if she denied him sex. It served as a stark reminder of how many in Mexico are exposed to misogyny from an early age. As outrage spread across social media yesterday, the university that runs the school said Urrea would face administrative procedures. Urrea apologised for his language but claimed he was merely acting out an \u201cexample of domestic violence\u201d to highlight the problem. \u201cHow dare he say these things when he\u2019s supposed to educate people? How are his pupils going to treat women with teachers like him?\u201d asked Karla, a 15-year-old student from the school. \u201cInstead of leading by example he does the opposite. He\u2019s encouraging others to think like he does,\u201d added Giselle, another schoolgirl. \u201cIt\u2019s very worrying. These messages are reinforced everywhere in Mexico, in television, religion, the family and now even in schools,\u201d said Sof\u00eda Virgen, a local representative of the Latin American and Caribbean Committee for the Defence of Women\u2019s Rights. \u201cThis creates the culture of machismo that results in people committing femicides.\u201d Thousands worldwide gathered to protest the conditions for their countries\u2019 women. In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, protesters urged President Rodrigo Duterte to address the pressing problems of lack of food, jobs and peace instead of killings and violence. In Melbourne, Australia, thousands called for decolonization, and end to racism, economic justice for all women, and reproductive rights. See more. A bookstore in Cleveland kicked off International Women\u2019s Day by turning around every volume on their shelves written by a male author. It took the eight employees of Loganberry Books, a new, used and rare bookstore with a feminist bent, two hours to go through nearly 10,000 titles. The books will stay facing backwards for several weeks throughout Women\u2019s History month. Harriet Logan, the store\u2019s founder, said the act was \u201ca metaphor of silencing the male voice \u2013 at least for this month\u201d. From Heat Street: To draw attention to female authors, a Cleveland bookstore celebrated Women\u2019s History Month by turning every male-written book in the fiction room backward on its shelf. Eight of the all-female employees of Loganberry Books went through about 10,000 books, a process that took about two hours. They\u2019ll leave the books turned around for the next two weeks. \u201cPictures are loud communicators,\u201d Harriett Logan, the bookstore\u2019s founder and owner, told Heat Street. \u201cSo we are in essence not just highlighting the disparity but bringing more focus to the women\u2019s books now, because they\u2019re the only ones legible on the shelf.\u201d \u201cTo give the floor and attention to women, you need to be able to hear them,\u201d Logan told Heat Street. \u201cAnd if someone else is talking over them, that just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d As part of a campaign to push Wall Street firms to place more women on their boards, the U.S. fund manager State Street on Tuesday installed a statue of girl opposite the famous Charging Bull. From Reuters: Although women have made some headway against the glass ceiling, State Street said one out of four of the companies that make up the Russell 3000 Index still have no female representation on their boards. \u201cToday, we are calling on companies to take concrete steps to increase gender diversity on their boards, and have issued clear guidance to help them begin to take action,\u201d State Street Global Advisors CEO Ron O\u2019Hanley said in a statement. Much the same as the charging bull, the little bronze girl by artist Kristen Visbal was put up in the wee hours of the morning as \u201cguerilla art,\u201d McNally said. But, unlike the bull, the firm discussed it with the city beforehand so that it could remain at least temporarily. \u201cWe\u2019re actively pursuing that it stays for a month,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the city decides that it should stay in perpetuity, we\u2019re absolutely on board with that.\u201d In Ireland\u2019s capital, thousands of demonstrators blocked traffic in the city center to protest the country\u2019s near-total ban on abortion. The Women\u2019s March is calling on people in Washington, DC to rally on the steps of Congress while Democratic women in the US House stage a symbolic walkout. In celebration of International Women\u2019s Day, the short film \u201cI March for ______,\u201d directed by Sam Campodonico-Ludwig, examines the growth of women\u2019s activism in the US with an intimate look at their divisions and similarities. In Argentina, a day of protest kicks off at 12pm ART with a \u201cruidazo\u201d \u2013 a widespread, noisy protest carried out by banging objects, usually pots and pans, from balconies or on sidewalks outside the home or workplace. The ruidazo will be followed by a 5pm march in the capital city of Buenos Aires from Congress to the Casa Rosada presidential palace. Argentina is home to the Ni Una Menos movement (or \u201cNot One Less,\u201d meaning not one more woman lost to male violence) a grassroots response to Argentina\u2019s high rates of deadly domestic violence. From 2008 to 2016, the rate at which Argentinian women are murdered shot up 78%. In 2012, Argentina passed a law in 2012 that recognized domestic violence homicides and honor killings as \u201cfemicide\u201d. There were 322 victims of femicide last year in Argentina, or one woman murdered every 30 hours. So far in 2017, the violence has not abated. Casa del Encuentro NGO, a safe home for victims of male violence, estimates that this year, one woman has died every 18 hours as a result of intimate partner or family violence. Today\u2019s 5pm march will be titled \u201cWe\u2019re Not All Here,\u201d in reference to the women lives have been lost. More school districts in the US are shutting down as the #DayWithoutAWoman campaign leaves them short-handed. Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools in North Carolina, Alexandria Virginia Public Schools in Virginia, and now, Prince George\u2019s County in Maryland: Several Prince George\u2019s County schools are still serving lunch for students who rely on its school lunch program. In the US House of Representatives, Democratic women are planning to stage a walkout Wednesday afternoon in solidarity with the women\u2019s strike. Several of them will speak in honor of International Women\u2019s Day, the Hill reports, and then, shortly after noon, they will walk out. \u201cI think it\u2019s important women in Congress show our solidarity,\u201d Rep. Lois Frankel, of Florida, told the Hill. Frankel helped arrange the walkout. The women won\u2019t be missing any votes, such as a vote on a defense spending bill that is expected to pass. \u201cWe considered a lot of different options, but our feeling is that there is so much mischief going on in this Congress that we cannot turn our backs,\u201d Frankel said. \u201cWe think it would actually be sort of the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish.\u201d International Women\u2019s Day is getting underway in the Americas. In the US, some media companies are already participating in the women\u2019s strike, or #DayWithoutAWoman. MTV\u2019s social media accounts are on autopilot: And the news sites Bustle and Romper have gone dark completely: For 24 hours, we will not be creating any new content on either of our sites or on any of our sites\u2019 social channels. Because, quite simply, without women, there is no Bustle. There is no Romper. Without our editorial team, which is 97 percent female, we would be unable to produce a site that aims to provide support and a megaphone for women to express how they\u2019re feeling about the world. And there\u2019s no time like the present to prove just how important those women\u2019s voices are to the world \u2014 to media, to business, and beyond. Some of its staff will spend the day volunteering for domestic violence shelters, food banks, and \u201cother charities that reach out to women and marginalized communities in need.\u201d International Women\u2019s Day events will be continuing throughout the globe today, and I am now handing over to my colleague Molly Redden in New York. Thank you to everyone who has tweeted, commented and emailed - and apologies to those I didn\u2019t get time to answer or include. We still want your stories: You can contribute via Guardian Witness here Tweet Molly on @mtredden Across the north of England, pressure is building for more women to be celebrated in statue form. In many cities and towns, the only women immortalised in stone or marble are either Queen Victoria, naked nymphs or other allegorical figures. In Carlisle, sculptor Hazel Reeves has just been commissioned to produce a statue of two \u201ccracker packers\u201d \u2014 female workers at the local McVities biscuit factory. Reeves has recently been shortlisted or the Emmeline Pankhurst statue commission for St Peter\u2019s Square, Manchester, and is well-known for her seven foot bronze sculpture of Sir Nigel Gresley in King\u2019s Cross Station. In Leeds, local MP Rachel Reeves is leading the call for a new female statue to join Henry Moore\u2019s naked reclining lady outside the city art gallery. Possible subjects include Olympic gold boxer Nicola Adams, social reformer Mary Gawthorpe, novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford or cycling hero Beryl Burton. Italy is marking International Women\u2019s Day by giving women free entry to all museum and cultural sites. But on a much more sober note, Italian president Sergio Mattarella used a speech in honour of IWD at the Presidential Palace in Rome to highlight the \u201ctragic, disturbing social emergency\u201d of femicide in Italy following a raft of high-profile murders. According to statistics released late last year, more than 100 women are killed in Italy each year in acts that are considered to be gender-related, in most cases by a woman\u2019s partner or ex-partner. It is estimated that another 3.5m women have been victims of stalking but that only 22 per cent of those victims have reported the incidents or sought help, according to Istat, the national statistics agency. Mattarella thanked women for their \u201cdaily and often strenuous action in favour of a fairer society, more welcoming, more united and integrated\u201d. Impressive smack down from Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor of people who have dismissed today\u2019s strike for International Women\u2019s Day as \u201cprivileged\u201d. There have been some who have suggested that in calling for women to \u201cstrike\u201d we are jeopardising those who do not have the \u201cluxury\u201d to call off work. Indeed, organisers of the women\u2019s strike have even been described as privileged. This is as ridiculous as it condescending to both the organisers and working-class women, who apparently are not viewed as capable of making decisions about their own activity on 8 March. Aside from ensuring there are multiple ways for women and their supporters to participate in the strike \u2013 including taking part in actions at work such as wearing red, as a gesture of solidarity \u2013 we have been inspired by the genuine grassroots nature that is animating cities, colleges, and communities across the country. ... In total, there are more than 60 events planned as part of today\u2019s strike. We have no idea how many people will participate. I don\u2019t expect the same millions who came out on 21 January to take part. But I do suspect thousands will be involved, and that is significant. The point was never to just hold a successful event, but to begin to knit together a network of ordinary people who can revive the struggles for racial and economic justice, sexual liberation and reproductive freedom that have always been at the nexus of the struggle for women\u2019s liberation. We have a world to win, and the women\u2019s strike is an important step in that process. AFP are reporting that a group of feminist activists have been detained in Moscow, after protesting by the Kremlin walls with a banner reading \u201cMen have been in power 200 years, down with them!\u201d AFP reports: OVD Info, a website that monitors detentions of activists, wrote that seven people were detained including two journalists from Novaya Gazeta opposition newspaper and a photographer and taken to a police station for questioning. Rights lawyer Mari Davtyan wrote on Facebook that eight had been detained including journalists. One of the detained activists, performance artist Yekaterina Nenasheva, posted a video of the protest on Facebook showing the activists standing on top of an artificial grotto in a park by the Kremlin walls, holding smoke flares. \u201cMoscow and St Petersburg feminists who seized the Kremlin congratulate you on March 8,\u201d Nenasheva wrote. The activists\u2019 banner referred to the fact that Russia\u2019s last female ruler was Catherine the Great, who died in 1796, more than 200 years ago. TV Rain independent channel reported that the women also carried banners reading \u201cA woman for president\u201d and \u201cWe are the majority.\u201d The protest resembled those by punk group Pussy Riot, who in 2012 lit flares and sang a song about President Vladimir Putin on a platform on Red Square. March 8 is a public holiday in Russia but is mainly celebrated by giving flowers and chocolates to women rather than stressing the need for gender equality. In a video address to the nation\u2019s women, Putin said that he and other men \u201cwill do all we can so that our beloved women are lavished with care and attention and smile more often.\u201d The UK government has announced \u00a320m of funding for services to support women and children who are victims of domestic violence in today\u2019s budget. Polly Neate, Chief Executive of Women\u2019s Aid, welcomed the \u201cdesperately needed\u201d boost to the sector: It\u2019s not a moment too soon, as Women\u2019s Aid\u2019s most recent national survey found that a third of domestic abuse services are running with no dedicated funding. The Prime Minister\u2019s strong commitment to helping survivors of domestic abuse is a fitting message for International Women\u2019s Day. With two women a week on average being killed by a partner or ex-partner in England and Wales, something has to change. When I left my flat for work this morning, my male neighbour from downstairs made a point of congratulating me on International Women\u2019s Day and warmly shook my hand. The day has more significance for ordinary citizens here than it does in the UK - most particularly in eastern parts, where under communism women - almost all of whom had jobs - were feted on this day, with flowers or being given time off work, sometimes even meals or drinks laid on by the boss, etc. Almost 30 years after the collapse of communism, this still happens in some workplaces, though the tradition is dying out. It\u2019s considered important enough that editorials in several leading German newspapers choose focus on it, arguing that recent global developments underline how we need IWD more than ever at a time when women\u2019s rights are so under attack. The liberal S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung from Munich writes: \u201cThe rise of populists in Germany, Russia, Turkey, America, Hungary, France and Poland has changed everything. They have brought back an image of women which we had thought had long been overcome. In Russia domestic violence will in future be treated as a much milder crime than it was previously, despite the fact that every year 12,000 women are battered to death by their partners. We should be under no illusion - despite regional differences, rights are being eroded in a similarly retrograde and discriminatory way. Women\u2019s rights are not collateral damage in the fight for the greater good, they are a barometer, a symptom of the internal state of a society. According to The Leipziger Volkszeitung: \u201cTrump, Putin and Erdogan are currently competing with each other in front of all of us for the position of biggest macho. What should we be doing to counteract this particularly difficult to deal with type of man?...Our motto should be \u2018the world needs strong women\u2019. The Lausitzer Rundschau, from Cottbus (like Leipzig in the former communist east) comments: \u201cthose who wants to change something but trusts in politics to do this, will wait forever. It was never a comfortable thing to fight for rights and freedoms. Dear women, you must become active yourselves, strengthen your networks and stand up together for your common interests. And we men should be your allies in this, and not just on this day.\u201d This is wonderful footage of the Suffragettes marching on London in 1915 for the right to vote and equal pay from the British Film Insitute. Some campaigners have argued that Spain still overlooks the massive contribution that women have made to society, culture and arts. As part of Madrid\u2019s belated efforts to honour some of the women who have been overshadowed by their more famous male peers, the city\u2019s mayor will unveil a plaque today to commemorate the Lyceum Women\u2019s Club, a meeting place for some of the leading intellectuals of pre-civil war Spain. The drive to remember their lives and contributions with plaques is being led by Nuria Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles, a professor of Hispanic and gender studies at the University of Exeter. Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles, and her film-maker collaborator, Tania Ballo, have so far provided the city council with research on more than 15 women, including the journalist, actor, writer and diplomat Isabel Oyarz\u00e1bal, the lawyer and politician Victoria Kent and the poet Ernestina de Champourc\u00edn. \u201cPeople, both Spanish and British, have written about Spain\u2019s ghosts, but the most important ghosts are the women \u2013 the invisible 50%,\u201d Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles told the Guardian recently. \u201cThe role of history and an awareness of our past is utterly fundamental. It\u2019s about learning about our diversity, our cultural heritage, about learning about our first attempt at genuine democracy at the beginning of the 20th century, which failed. We need to learn from our past; it\u2019s there as a lesson.\u201d This is a fascinating tale of the history of women in science for International Women\u2019s Day. Rousing words: [E]ven though it may increasingly feel like the end of the road for those enlightenment values that people around the world will march for on 22 April, as long as we show up, we have hope. A quote normally attributed to the anthropologist Margaret Mead puts it best: \u201cNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\u201d More than 500 women in Thailand, Philippines and India participated in a global solidarity strike for their rights today, according to The Asia Pacific Forum on Women Law and Development (APWLD). APWLD\u2019s Regional Coordinator Kate Lappin said: This action is part of ongoing efforts to increase the power of global solidarity strikes as we believe solidarity is the only possible antidote to the growing authoritarianism, deepening inequalities, runaway climate change and sexist leadership the world is experiencing. Edna Velarde of Amihan National Federation of Peasant Women , Philippines said: The peasant women joined today\u2019s strike to call on the Duterte administration to turn down neoliberal policies detrimental to the country and fulfill its promises to the Filipino people to provide land to the tillers, food on the table and respect for human rights. Elizabeth Khumallambam of Nari Shakti Manch, India said: Women working in unorganized sector continue to face discrimination - unequal wages, sexual harassment at workplaces, absence of social security and maternity benefits. In voicing these suppressions, our strength lies in solidarities across spectrums. This is an absolute must read for International Women\u2019s Day, six inspiring activists share their secrets about how to win a feminist battle. This from Leymah Gwobee, part of a group of mothers ended Liberia\u2019s civil war via non-violent action, including a sex strike: We were ordinary mothers who decided it was no longer enough to beg for peace. Instead, we came together to demand peace, justice, equality and inclusion in political decision-making. We used our bodies, broken by hunger, poverty, desperation and destitution, to stare down the barrel of the gun. Fourteen years later, we can comfortably say that we did the unimaginable. Sobering news of a domestic stabbing in Wolverhampton in the UK on IWD. It is believed a man attacked two women, killing one and critically injuring another before killing himself. According to Women\u2019s Aid on average two women are killed by their partner or ex-partner every week in England and Wales. This from my colleague Jamie Grierson: Two people have died following a domestic stabbing at a block of flats, including the attacker, in a Wolverhampton incident that sparked a significant emergency services response including armed police and air ambulances. Police were called to a block of flats in Leasowes Drive, in the Merry Hill area of the city, at around 9.45am where it is believed a man attacked two women before inflicting stab injuries on himself, West Midlands police said. Officers used stun grenades as they stormed the flat in a bid to distract and detain the knifeman, the force said. A woman believed to be in her 30s died at the scene while the male suspect, also believed to be in his 30s, was pronounced dead a short time later, WMP said. Nadja Sayej has written a lovely piece about the Iranian TV that is promoting women\u2019s rights. Worth a read this IWD. Here\u2019s a taster: \u2018Oops, I did it again,\u201d was Maryam Faghihimani\u2019s reaction when the Iranian regime accused her TV show of the horrible crime of promoting women\u2019s rights. She immediately took to Facebook, explaining to her friends that a state news site had also blurred out her bare arms and legs, to protect their honour. \u201cI am humble and proud of those crimes and sin,\u201d she added, \u201cand will continue my efforts.\u201d Satellite TV is becoming a powerful way for Iranian women to connect with the wider world. Over 70% of Iranian households have satellites to watch international television, and one of the most popular stations is the London-based Manoto TV. A liberal Persian channel with over three million Facebook followers, Manoto airs reality TV, cooking shows \u2013 and now, its first ever women\u2019s talk show, a Middle Eastern version of the American smash-hit The View. The show \u2013 Samte No (which translates as New Direction) \u2013 is a huge step forward in a country where YouTube and other anti-Islamic websites are blocked and it is banned for women to dance, perform music on stage, ride bikes, watch male sports teams, wear leggings or reject their husband\u2019s sexual advances. \u201cWearing makeup or even nail polish, you\u2019ll pay a fine,\u201d explains Faghihimani. \u201cHijab is mandatory and any tight outfits will result in arrest by the moral police.\u201d This from GuardianWitness: Kripa Joshi, an illustrator from Nepal, is celebrating International Women\u2019s Day with five generations of women in her family. She is also the creator of the character Miss Moti who emerged from Kripa\u2019s struggle with weight and whose name means a big woman in Nepali. To mark today she\u2019s highlighting some Miss Moti-vational messages. Feminists striking, marching and wearing red in solidarity for International Women\u2019s Day today will surely be delighted to hear that US president Donald Trump has tweeted to mark the day. For fun, here is a truncated selection of the times Trump has been accused of misogyny: Bragged he could \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy\u201d and kiss and grope them because he is a star. Briefly advocated \u201csome form of punishment\u201d for women who had abortions Attacked the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, calling her a \u201cbimbo\u201d incapable of objectivity when there was \u201cblood coming out of her whatever\u201d - widely interpreted as a thinly veiled reference to her menstrual cycle. As Kelly pointed out Trump has, at different times, \u201ccalled women you don\u2019t like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.\u201d Critics reacted accordingly: Never shy of getting in on the action, singer Lily Allen tweeted: This year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day has huge resonance in Warsaw and across Poland. Today women have gathered outside the Law and Justice headquarters to protest at continuing discrimination against women and to stand up for women\u2019s reproductive rights. Polish women attracted worldwide attention in October during the so-called \u2018Black Protest\u2019 against a blanket ban on abortion under consideration in the Polish parliament that would have prohibited terminations under almost all circumstances, including of pregnancies resulting from rape and incest. The government beat a hasty retreat in the face of the protests, but campaigners warn that Polish women remain under threat from the government and its relationship with hardline elements of the Polish Catholic Church - a feeling shared by many believers and non-believers alike. As Jaga, 34, told the Guardian: Whether you have experienced childbirth, or you know someone whose child died after delivery, or you know someone having to raise a disabled child alone, women are sharing stories. These are not topics you raise at the dinner table at Christmas, but thanks to the abortion bill, people started to talk about them. It is the first IWM since many Polish women found their voice, and won. There is now a palpable sense that if and when change comes to Poland, it will have been its women that won it. The UK government\u2019s department of international development are having a busy International Women\u2019s Day and have made this short video highlighting the work of women who manifest this year\u2019s theme of #BeBoldForChange. International Development Secretary Priti Patel said: We all know that women are part of the solution; that women\u2019s participation in education, health, politics and peace building increases the chances of a more prosperous and stable future. Yet we must also remain alive to the many challenges that still come before girls and women to have an equal part in this story. So we stand with them all, in every way. Seventeen women have been killed so far this year by their partners or ex-partners in Spain, writes my colleague Sam Jones in Madrid. The figure means that more women have died as a result of gender-based violence in the first four months of 2017 than died over the course of last year, when the total stood at 11. Statistics also show that this year has already overtaken 2008 (15 deaths) as the worst year on record for such violence. The situation has prompted protests and led a group of women to go on a month-long hunger strike in the famous Puerta del Sol square in central Madrid. The strikers ended their protest on Tuesday but vowed to press on with their 25-point plan to tackle gender-based violence. The German composer Fanny Mendelssohn is finally due to be recognised in Britain as a musician with the talent to match her brother, the more famous Felix, when a piano sonata long attributed to him is performed at lunchtime today. The British premiere of Fanny\u2019s Easter Sonata which will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 at 1pm - is as much a tribute to the German woman, who wrote it 140 years ago, as it is to the many women composers over the ages who have not received the recognition they deserve. The manuscript of \u2018Easter Sonata\u2019 was first identified as being Fanny\u2019s work in 2010, when an American academic, Angela Mace Christian, tracked it down to a private archive in France and had it analysed. Fanny was only 23 when she wrote it. She had referred to the piece in her diary, including the fact she had played it at home in April 1829. But like most of the 500 works she wrote, it never came to public attention.Pianist Sofya Gulyak will resurrect the work at the Royal College of Music. Fanny\u2019s great great great granddaughter, Shiela Hayman, tells her story in The Guardian today. In France a \u201cstrike\u201d called for by feminist organisations is due to start at 3h40 this afternoon. This is the symbolic time after which French women are considered to work for free when their wages are compared with male colleagues. In Paris there will be a gathering at Place de la R\u00e9publique at 2pm followed by a march to Place de l\u2019opera at 5.30. There are protests in cities across France. But a recent controversy suggests France still has a long way to go before achieving gender equality. Green party MP Denis Baupin was last year investigated after claims of sexual aggression and harassment against four women. The women were, according to investigators, convincing witnesses, giving \u201cmeasured declarations that did not change and were corroborated... about events some of which could be considered criminal\u201d. One of the women is a French MP for the Green/Ecology party, one is the party secretary, one a local mayor and one a regional councillor. However, the case was dropped because it was out of time as the alleged harassment happened in the late 1990s.Now, Baupin, 54, has said he is going to sue the women for making \u201cfalse accusations\u201d. Russian president Vladimir Putin has issued a gushing message to the women of Russia, praising their \u201cbeauty and vitality\u201d and, of course, their timekeeping abilities. In a statement Putin said: Dear women: mothers, grandmothers, daughters, wives, friends, our nearest and dearest ones, please accept my heartfelt congratulations on International Women\u2019s Day! You fill this world with beauty and vitality, giving warmth and comfort, cordiality and harmony with your tenderness and generosity of spirit. You care day and night for your children, grandchildren and your family. Even today, on International Women\u2019s Day, you are still caught up in your routine, working tirelessly, always on time. We often ask ourselves, how do they manage it all? Many have pointed out that Putin has recently signed into law a controversial amendment that decriminalises some forms of domestic violence. On International Women\u2019s day the president of the European Parliament hhas vowed that a Polish lawmaker will be punished for sexist comments he made last week. EU parliament President Antonio Tajani said that he intends to bring a \u201cswift conclusion\u201d to the probe into the remarks of radical right-winger Janusz Korwin-Mikke at the legislature and promised \u201ca penalty commensurate with the gravity of the offence.\u201d During a debate on the pay gap between men and women Korwin-Mikke said: \u201cOf course women must earn less than men because they are weaker, they are smaller, they are less intelligent. They must earn less, that\u2019s all.\u201d He could face sanctions such as a reprimand, a temporary suspension or a fine. Hopefully a big one. In the Middle East the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) is marking International Women\u2019s Day with a timely reminder of the need for greater protection for women human rights defenders in the region. On IWD a march will take take in Lebanon, organised by the WHRDs Middle East and North Africa Coalition. Here is a sobering reminder of the dangers and harassment people fighting for equality face in many countries throughout the world. In 2017, hundreds of women are still in captivity, detention, exile, many are under surveillance, travel bans and judicial harassment, while others are subjected to torture, disappearance or murder as a result of their human rights activities. In conflict zones, targeting women increases in parallel with the increase of violence, where sexual violence against girls and women is used as a tool of war, human trafficking, and early marriage plus other types of targetings puts women at greater risk. The organisation points out that women in Iraq, Iraqi Kurdistan, Syria, and Yemen are targeted daily just for being women. According to the GCHR they work \u201cunder government surveillance, risk of persecution, detention and torture for demanding their basic rights such as social rights in Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and political rights in Bahrain, while others are struggling to have a voice in shrinking civil spaces in countries including the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.\u201d The organisation points to 2017 as a year of momentous change for women in the middle east: Despite all odds, women refuse to be submissive, oppressed, marginalised, used and excluded; instead they have found strength in solidarity, and collaborative work. The beginning of this year showed how women can mobilise their efforts to refuse patriarchy and challenge the status quo. If you needed any more reason to love the small but powerful nation of Iceland, here\u2019s another: the country has just become the first country in the world to require companies to prove they offer equal pay regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexuality and nationality. This from the ministry of Social Affairs and Equality: The certification requires companies with more than 25 employees to not only offer equal pay for equal work, but also equal pay for work of the same value. The Equal Pay Standard, on which the certification requirements are based, does this by assessing a company\u2019s pay policies, classification of jobs according to equal value and wage research on the basis of the classification, as well as formalizing policies and processes related to pay decisions. The move aims to help the country achieve its aim of eradicating the country\u2019s gender gap by 2022 Iceland\u2019s Minister of Social Affairs and Equality, \u00deorsteinn V\u00edglundsson said: As a country we set ourselves the challenge to eradicate the gender pay gap by 2022 but, despite taking steps such as introducing dedicated paid leave for new dads and 40% quotas for women on boards of larger companies, we have not made the progress we would have wished. It is the right time to do something radical about this issue. We want to show the world that eradicating the gender pay gap is an achievable goal and we hope other nations will follow suit in adopting the Equal Pay Standard in years to come. Iceland has a long and proud history of leading the way on gender equality. For the past eight years it has topped the World Economic Forum\u2019s gender gap index. The Economist recently named Iceland the world\u2019s best place for working women \u2013 in comparison, the UK came in at No. 24. You can read the joyous story of 90% of Icelandic women going on strike in 1975 here. The UK parliament Women and Equalities Select Committee have done a video encouraging women to get into politics. The chair Maria Miller told me for a IWD story last week, that the WESC has been made permanent. Also, she believed having a female prime minister - coupled with MPs from both sides of the divide being prepared to work for common goals - was making a quiet difference to improving policy on women\u2019s issues. It\u2019s worth following @5050Parliament for the campaign for better female representation in the UK parliament. If you want to take one small action for IWD, you can sign their petition here: An example of how people are using this year\u2019s IWD to fight for political goals can be seen in Ireland. where women are preparing to strike and march in a bid to push the government to call a referendum on reproductive rights. People are gathering on the bridge in Dublin at 12.30. You can read more about the push to repeal the 8th amendment, which amounts to a constitutional ban on abortion in Ireland, by my colleague Henry McDonald.

Thanks to Rob Shaw who has directed me to the resplendent front page of Wikipedia today, which - among other fabulous women - is celebrating the achievements of top scouser Bessie Braddock. It\u2019s worth checking out. In Sheffield in the UK protesters are using the Women of Steel statue [see my colleague Helen Pidd\u2019s previous story on the statue here] to voice their opposition to the new Bishop of Sheffield\u2019s views on the ordination of women. Hello from London! And happy International Women\u2019s Day to all. Huge thanks to the incredible Claire Phipps who has put in a sterling shift for the sisterhood from Australia. I\u2019ll be here for much of the day and I would love to hear your stories and see pictures of how you are marking the day. Are you striking? Wearing a specific colour? Get in touch! I\u2019m on alexandra.topping@theguardian.com and on twitter @lexytopping I\u2019m handing over the blog now to my colleague Lexy Topping in London \u2013 she\u2019ll continue to update you on events, protests and everything else as International Women\u2019s Day continues its way around the globe. Thanks for reading and for your comments and contributions \u2013 do keep them coming. A key feature of 2017\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day is the call for \u201ca day without women\u201d \u2013 for women to take the day off work (paid and unpaid, at home and out of the home); to avoid shopping for the day,\u201cwith exceptions for small, women- and minority-owned businesses\u201d; and to wear red in solidarity. In America, the call to strike has been led by the organisers of the Women\u2019s March, which took place across the US (and the world) the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration. A group of feminist activists and academics wrote recently in the Guardian about the need to strike: The idea is to mobilise women, including trans women, and all who support them in an international day of struggle \u2013 a day of striking, marching, blocking roads, bridges, and squares, abstaining from domestic, care and sex work, boycotting, calling out misogynistic politicians and companies, striking in educational institutions. These actions are aimed at making visible the needs and aspirations of those whom lean-in feminism ignored: women in the formal labor market, women working in the sphere of social reproduction and care, and unemployed and precarious working women. In embracing a feminism for the 99%, we take inspiration from the Argentinian coalition Ni Una Menos. Violence against women, as they define it, has many facets: it is domestic violence, but also the violence of the market, of debt, of capitalist property relations, and of the state; the violence of discriminatory policies against lesbian, trans and queer women; the violence of state criminalization of migratory movements; the violence of mass incarceration; and the institutional violence against women\u2019s bodies through abortion bans and lack of access to free healthcare and free abortion. But Guardian columnist Lindy West, speaking on Australian TV this week, while agreeing that \u201cprotest is most effective when it disrupts people\u2019s lives\u201d, echoed concerns of others who are cautious about the proposed strike: It would be tremendously effective if we could mobilise every single woman in the world \u2026 A concern for me, as a very privileged, financially stable white woman who works from home \u2026 it\u2019s very easy for me to say yes, everyone should go on strike but I want to be very cognisant of the fact there are very many women who cannot afford to lose one day\u2019s worth of pay, let alone risk their job. You can find details of strikes and other protests taking place around the world from Australia to Uruguay via the links on this page. And here are some ways you can take part if you\u2019re not striking: Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo Cox was murdered last year, has shared this picture of the Labour MP for International Women\u2019s Day: In the UK, International Women\u2019s Day coincides \u2013 or collides \u2013 with the Budget. Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti argues that austerity is a feminist issue, with women more likely to be single parents, earn less and work part-time than their male counterparts. It\u2019s 19 November, since you ask. If you\u2019d like to hear more about how International Men\u2019s Day is on 19 November, can I suggest you follow comedian Richard Herring on Twitter, as he endures his annual feat of replying to all the people wondering when International Men\u2019s Day is. Here\u2019s what Herring wrote for the Guardian on International Men\u2019s Day in 2015: International Women\u2019s Day is on 8 March: 24 hours (of the 8,760 annually available) set aside to celebrate women and all of their achievements. And people get furious about it. Surely, you might think, you could only be cross about it because that definitely isn\u2019t enough time to celebrate the achievements of over than 50% of the population. But no \u2026 So for the last two International Women\u2019s Days I have tried to highlight this stupidity. I have got up early, logged on to Twitter and searched for the phrase \u201cinternational men\u2019s day\u201d, found every single person who has tweeted the question and responded to them all individually: \u201cIt\u2019s 19 November.\u201d There are thousands to get through. It goes on relentlessly, for hours and hours, but I try to get to them all because to see the same moronic question asked over and over again by people (who don\u2019t even think just to check Google to make sure they\u2019re not making an arse of themselves) is very funny, and shows exactly why an international women\u2019s day is necessary. Incidentally, nobody tweets me back to say: \u201cOh thanks for the information. I was wondering when it was.\u201d Almost like they don\u2019t want to know the answer to their own question. My hope is that if I can spend a day a year dealing with this issue, then that means that everyone else can get on with making International Women\u2019s Day about celebrating women and not complaining about the supposed raw deal men get. So I let men know that they do have a day if they want to celebrate themselves. Though not many of them do when it comes along, weirdly. On 24 October 1975, the women of Iceland did no housework, to protest against their feeble, 5% representation in parliament. They technically went on everything-strike, but since their democratic exclusion was mirrored in the workplace, this functionally meant they stopped looking after their children and doing the washing-up (those who did have jobs worked in schools and nurseries, so those had to close as well). A staggering 90% of women took part, after the genius move of renaming it, not a strike, but a \u201cWomen\u2019s Day Off\u201d, dressing up stridency as me-time. Men had to take their children to work, which gave the event its other name: The Long Friday. This action changed the face of Icelandic politics, delivering to Europe its first female president, Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir, five years later. But its significance in the wider feminist landscape is subtler, since that tension of where you situate domestic labour in the fight for equality is, if anything, more pronounced now than it was then. Feminism at home sounds a lot like nagging. The strike was underpinned by a movement, the radical Red Stockings in Iceland, and sister organisations across Europe making the case for paid housework. We now broadly reject domestic responsibilities as innately female, so would struggle to galvanise action around them. Yet we still do most of them (statistically, I mean; I don\u2019t personally, I am a slut) and they are still unpaid. I struggle to see much victory in this turn of events. If you want victory, go to Poland: \u201cThe so-called Black Protest last October,\u201d feminist activist Katarzyna Bielinska tells me, \u201cwas provoked by an attempt to tighten already the extremely restrictive abortion law in Poland by introducing an even more barbarian bill, banning abortion totally, making a woman who aborts liable for five years\u2019 imprisonment, criminalising miscarriage and blocking prenatal foetus investigation and treatment.\u201d Tens of thousands of women went on strike, or \u2013 this detail pleases me \u2013 went to work but dressed in black, and didn\u2019t do anything. More than 140 cities, towns and municipalities were profoundly affected, especially public-sector work. \u201cThe success was huge and unexpected,\u201d Bielinska says. \u201cThe governing Law and Justice party rejected the bill three days after.\u201d Today is on course to be one of the most political International Women\u2019s Days in history, Alexandra Topping and Molly Redden report: From Thailand to Poland, the United States to Australia, the first Global Women\u2019s Strike will see action on both the industrial and domestic fronts, with participants keen to show solidarity with an energised global women\u2019s movement. \u201cWe are united, we are international \u2013 and we are everywhere,\u201d said Klementyna Suchanow, a Poland-based organiser of the Global Women\u2019s Strike, adding that the walkout would put governments and institutions under pressure by giving women a voice that has long been ignored. \u201cWe are an army of women across the globe and we are no longer asking to be listened to. The world is being forced to listen to us.\u201d The theme for 2017\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day \u2013 which celebrates the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women \u2013 is #BeBoldForChange. Organisers of the Global Women\u2019s Strike have joined forces with coordinators of the Women\u2019s March and hundreds of human rights and women\u2019s campaigners to capitalise on momentum in the movement in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election. Up to 2 million people around the world marched for equality in January the day after his inauguration. The Women\u2019s March \u2013 which now has organisers across 200 cities in 80 countries \u2013 has called on supporters not to engage in paid or unpaid labour and only spend money in small and female-owned businesses. Recognising that the poor financial situation and rigid work laws mean many will not be able to take part in a physical strike, organisers are urging supporters to wear red, a colour historically associated with the labour movement, in solidarity. In other countries women will wear black, or different colours, while the focus on issues from femicide to abortion will be decided in each nation. The relationship between feminism and capitalism is a twisty one, but in the US Wall Street is making its own International Women\u2019s Day statement with this statue of a girl facing down the charging bull. Reuters reports: Placing the diminutive, school-aged girl in front of the massive bull on the eve of International Women\u2019s Day was a way of calling attention to the lack of gender diversity on corporate boards and the pay gap of women working in financial services, a spokeswoman for Wall Street firm State Street Global Advisors said. \u201cA lot of people talk about gender diversity, but we really felt we had to take it to a broader level,\u201d said Anne McNally. Although women have made some headway against the glass ceiling, State Street said one out of four of the companies that make up the Russell 3000 Index still have no female representation on their boards. The little bronze girl by artist Kristen Visbal was put up in the wee hours of the morning as \u201cguerilla art\u201d, McNally said. But the firm discussed it with the city beforehand so that it could remain at least temporarily. \u201cWe\u2019re actively pursuing that it stays for a month,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the city decides that it should stay in perpetuity, we\u2019re absolutely on board with that.\u201d In Greece, the Eurozone\u2019s weakest member state, the governing left-wing Syriza party has issued a rousing statement to mark International Womens\u2019 Day. After eight years of economic crisis and depression-era poverty, the ruling Syriza party elected to mark the day tapping into the radical rhetoric that first swept it to power. Women, it said, were not only poorer wherever they lived, they were paid less than men for the same work, while the violence often perpetuated against them was \u201cthe most widespread crime in the world and harmed the life, dignity and freedom of half the world\u2019s population\u201d. Applauding the protest action women had taken over the past year, \u201cfrom the squares of Argentina to those in European cities and Turkey\u201d, women, it said, had marched against gender violence, racism, sexism, Donald Trump\u2019s misogynist agenda and the policies and effects of austerity. The 8th of March is a reminder that in our country female unemployment, especially among the young, has soared. The shrinking of the social state brought about by the politics of austerity over the last decade has further encumbered women regarding care for children and old people. Under the stewardship of Greece\u2019s first ever leftist government, legislation outlining the equality of the sexes had been drafted and would soon be put to parliament and sexist language removed from all public documents, it added. Less than 19% of the 300-seat Greek parliament is represented by female MPs. In Afghanistan, Reporters Without Borders says it will today hold an opening ceremony for the country\u2019s first Centre for the Protection of Afghan Women Journalists, in Kabul. Afghan journalist Farida Nikzad will head the new centre, which says its aim is \u201cto assist and protect women journalists, especially those working in remote parts of Afghanistan, who are more vulnerable\u201d. Nikzad explains: The creation of this centre is intended to send a strong message not only to Afghan women journalists, but also to all of the country\u2019s women. We want to support women journalists both in war zones and within the news organisations for which they work, to defend both their rights and their physical safety. To that end, we need the government and media owners to commit to do their part in what is a key battle for Afghan society. The centre says it is already working with 10 female journalists, five of them in conflict zones. Reporters Without Borders says many women have been forced to give up work in the media due to violence: In some regions, there are no longer any women journalists at all. Three of the 10 journalists and media workers killed in 2016 were women. Thirteen women journalists and media workers (including five foreigners) have been killed since 2001, and at least 10 have had to flee the country. Afghanistan is ranked 120th out of 180 countries in RSF\u2019s 2016 World Press Freedom Index. Today is International Women\u2019s Day. There is much to celebrate when it comes to progress for women throughout the world. There is also much to lament, both in relation to what still needs to be done and where the gains we have made risk going backwards. Stillbirth, however, is standing still. The incidence of stillbirth is the same today as it has been for decades. Very little money or attention goes into research to reduce or prevent stillbirth. Why? Stillbirth struggles on two fronts. One, stillbirth is a thing that happens inside a woman\u2019s body. In a male-dominated world, stillbirth is easily relegated as a private tragedy rather than as a public health matter. Two, stillbirth is not a cause feminists want to champion. Even though stillbirth is a tragedy for thousands of women each year, most feminists don\u2019t want to talk about the death of a baby inside its mother\u2019s womb. Many feminists get uneasy about anything that gets a bit too close to abortion rights. So let\u2019s be clear: stillbirth happens to women who want to be mothers, who have chosen to take a baby to term. It has nothing to do with abortion. Many mothers of stillborn babies are pro-choice and would not seek to restrict women\u2019s access to abortion services. If feminists believe women\u2019s choices should be respected, then there is nothing to fear from recognising a woman\u2019s choice to be a mother. There is everything to gain from demanding that society take seriously a public health problem that devastates six women and their babies a day in Australia. Found a hidden feminist book? Do let us know where and what! It\u2019s estimated more than 1,000 early years workers walked off the job today at 3.20pm \u2013 the time that women in Australia effectively start working for free. Early childhood educator Julie Lofts said she wanted the government to recognise the value of her work. After 18 years in the industry, she said she continued to live paycheque to paycheque, and had struggled to raise two sons balancing bills and \u201csome quality of life\u201d. \u201cI should be paid a lot more than what I get now,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t do this for the money, I do it because it\u2019s a job that I love. But I\u2019m not paid according to my qualifications.\u201d Carley Adams, an educator at the same centre, had been \u201cshocked\u201d to discover how little she would earn when she joined the sector six years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s my career, it\u2019s not just a job I come to every day \u2026 When you find something you love to do it\u2019s hard to leave it, but if I don\u2019t get a pay rise I would have to leave eventually, which is sad.\u201d India\u2019s minister for women has sparked anger and ridicule after saying female students need curfews to protect them from their own \u201chormonal outbursts\u201d. AFP reports: Many Indian universities inflict curfews on women while allowing their male students freedom to stay out at night, a policy that critics say is sexist and outdated. Asked about the practice on the NDTV news channel, Manekha Gandhi said it was necessary to protect young women from their own hormones. \u201cTo protect you from your own hormonal outbursts, perhaps a certain protection, a Lakshman Rekha [red line] is drawn,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can make it [the curfew] six, seven or eight, that depends on college to college but it really is for your own safety,\u201d she told the studio audience of college students during a special show to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Gandhi said a similar deadline should be put in place for male students, but many social media users ridiculed her for her comments. \u201cYou know what would be safest? Lock hormonal men in, instead of denying women the right to lead a full life,\u201d tweeted one critic. Gandhi, who is the sister-in-law of opposition leader Sonia Gandhi, is no stranger to controversy. Last year she angered women\u2019s rights campaigners arguing for a law against marital rape by saying that could not apply in India because society viewed marriage as sacrosanct. In 2015, female students in Delhi launched a campaign against the curfews under the name Pinjra Tod (\u201cBreak the Cage\u201d). University residences generally justify the rules with concern for the safety of young women in a country where sexual violence is widespread. A flicker of controversy from the US, where the lights have gone out on the Statue of Liberty. Was Lady Liberty joining the Day Without Women and showing her support for the global IWD strike? Plenty on social media seemed to think so. Sadly, the reason turned out to be rather more mundane: As our Southeast Asia correspondent Oliver Holmes reports, the forced marriage of women and girls from Myanmar into China has been highlighted today by the Freedom Fund, a private philanthropic initiative dedicated to ending slavery. The organisation\u2019s CEO, Nick Grono, has been travelling around Myanmar during the past few days and sends this report: China\u2019s one-child policy, and the preference of parents for boys, means that by 2025-2030, an estimated 22 to 30 million Chinese men will be unable to find women to marry. This is creating a huge demand for foreign \u2018wives\u2019. We heard devastating stories from women who have returned from China. One told us how she travelled to what she thought was a well-paying job in the north of Myanmar, only to be sold into marriage in China. She was trapped near Beijing for seven years, and had two daughters with her \u2018husband\u2019, only to then be deported by Chinese police to Myanmar. She has not had contact with her daughters since then. Another told us how she was deceived by a friend (who turned out to be a marriage broker) to travel to the border with China. There she was sold to a Chinese man for US$9,300. When she did not become pregnant within seven months, this man sold her to another Chinese man for $11,500. She was trapped in that \u2018marriage\u2019 for three years before her family and Myanmar police managed to secure her release. We heard many other equally heart-wrenching stories. Grono has met with Myanmar officials in the capital, Naypyitaw, and says there is a genuine willingness by the authorities to fight forced marriage. He said the Freedom Fund has a strategy ready and hopes to establish a presence in the country. Zehra Khan has much to celebrate on International Women\u2019s Day. It is exactly four months since members of the Home-Based Women Workers Federation (HBWWF) in Sindh province in Pakistan \u2013 of which Khan is secretary general \u2013 finally received legal recognition. The province\u2019s chief minister, Syed Murad Ali Shah, signed a policy that means the region\u2019s estimated 5 million home-based workers \u2013 the majority of whom are women \u2013 can register as workers and access benefits. \u201cIt was an important day not only for the history of the labour movement in Sindh and Pakistan, but also for south Asia,\u201d says Khan, whose federation has more than 4,500 members. \u201cOnce they are legally accepted as workers, they can be registered with the government-run social security institution, [and] be part of [the] workers\u2019 welfare board to enjoy benefits like health, education and housing, as well as those offered after retirement,\u201d she adds. Almost 80% of an estimated 12 million Pakistani home-based workers are women. As well as unpaid domestic work, the women often spend up to 10 hours a day making garments, footwear, sports goods, and arts and crafts behind closed doors. Their work is often invisible to the rest of the world, despite having propped up the country\u2019s informal economy for so long. \u201cThey are left to negotiate with the middlemen. Many often get deprived of payment or chastised if they demand better wages,\u201d says Khan. The new government policy, however, brings hope that this kind of exploitation will soon come to an end. Once registered as workers, the women will be able to demand a basic level of pay as set out in the Minimum Wages Act of 2015. Raising a few eyebrows in Australia today is this IWD tribute by Liberal senator Eric Abetz, who has taken to Facebook (retweeted here by Labor MP Tony Burke) to praise Queen Elizabeth II. Fair enough, to a point: plenty of people would applaud her role in public life. As an example of where \u201chard work and commitment\u201d can get you in life, the logic goes a little astray. But the most jarring note is surely that dismissal of \u201cdemanding that people \u2026 artificially promote you simply because of your sex\u201d. If Elizabeth had had a brother \u2013 even a younger one \u2013 she would not have been entitled to that throne at all, of course. In Australia, more than 1,000 early childhood educators have walked off the job to campaign for equal pay in the \u201cpink-collar\u201d sector. Dozens of childcare centres closed mid-afternoon on International Women\u2019s Day, said to be the largest action taken by the sector in Australia. The national gender pay gap in Australia is 16.2%, but female-dominated industries attract lower wages than those made up of mostly men. The childcare sector is 97% women but qualified early childhood educators earn some of the lowest wages in the country \u2013 as little as $20.61 an hour, or about half the national average wage. It was estimated more than walked off the job at 3.20pm \u2013 the time that women in Australia effectively start working for free. Helen Gibbons, the assistant national secretary of the early childhood union United Voice, said participating educators had worked closely with parents over a matter of weeks to ensure they would not be inconvenienced by the industrial action. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really excited and pleased to see that a lot of parents are really supportive of this campaign and in fact many parents will be joining the educators when they\u2019re walking off the job this afternoon.\u201d India has launched its first all-women cricket league to promote women\u2019s cricket. The sport, which enjoys enormous popularity in India, has been dominated by men for decades. Founders say the want a women\u2019s league that enjoys the same prestige as the male Indian Premier League, which has drawn cricket stars from around the world and has huge sponsorship from multinational companies and celebrities. In a statement, founder Parul Jain said, \u201cIt\u2019s important that young girls coming through can see cricket as a viable option to play at the highest level. The WCL #T20 League is expected to be of the same repute as the Indian Premier League (IPL) and women Big Bash League of Australia in support of women.\u201d \u201cThis will lead to greater interest in women\u2019s cricket in India, which has generally been given much less importance than the men\u2019s sport. With many sports getting their own professional leagues and ever-growing popularity in the country, it is time that the women cricket league is formed. It is no surprise that the fierce team of eves does not get as much attention and opportunities neither from the sports bodies or the sponsors in India as the men\u2019s team,\u201d he said. Founders say India has hundreds of millions of women cricket fans, but few opportunities to play the sport at a professional level. The league will encourage women competitors, who are often discouraged from playing sports, especially in more conservative parts of the country. Sunita Sharma, the country\u2019s first female cricket coach, who is closely associated with the project said, \u201cIt\u2019s been more than three decades since the Indian women cricket team has been formed and has won various matches globally, still there is hardly any acknowledgement to women as per men cricketers in India.\u201d An Australian women is running 3,000km across 184 countries in support of rape survivors following her own personal attack, Oliver Holmes reports. Claire McFarlane began the campaign, named Footsteps to Inspire, in July last year in what she hopes will \u201cremove the taboo around rape, support the healing process and ultimately make lasting change\u201d. \u201cIn 1999, I was brutally raped and left for dead on the streets of Paris,\u201d McFarlane said in an email to the Guardian. \u201cWhat followed was an arduous, long battle to find justice and it only came to an end in October 2015. Through sharing my own story of survival, I\u2019ve become an advocate for survivors of rape.\u201d McFarlane will run 16km in each country to signify the 16 years it took for her case against a perpetrator to go through the court system. She has started raising donations for her run, which has taken her from South Africa to India to Papua New Guinea. It will take four years to complete, with McFarlane moving country every week. She ran most recently in Singapore and landed in the Philippines on Monday night. Her next run is on Saturday on the west coast of Luzon, in an area called Zambales. McFarlane says she is using beach running as a way to tackle the issue of rape in an empowering way. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to use a very different medium to talk about rape: that is, adventure and sport. Sport unites us and often brings people together to make a stand for something they believe in,\u201d she said. Funds raised for the cause are donated to local projects or organisations helping rape survivors as well as part of the cost of the trip, in which McFarlane meets with NGOs working to combat sexual violence. McFarlane will also collect data on survivors of sexual violence in all 184 nations, which she will compile for a research report. Some readers have been in touch to let me know what they have been, or will be, doing to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Do feel free to contact me on Twitter @Claire_Phipps, or via the comments below. There was more unwelcome news for Japan ahead of International Women\u2019s Day, reports Justin McCurry from Tokyo, with the release of a report showing that the country ranks 163rd out of 193 countries in female representation in lower houses of parliament. The defence minister, Tomomi Inada; the leader of the biggest opposition party, Renho Murata; and the governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, are all women, but Japan trails behind all of its G7 counterparts in overall political representation, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The report, released on Wednesday, did note, however, that a record 28 women were elected to Japan\u2019s upper house last July. Koike, who has criticised the golf venue for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics over its sexist membership policy, is aiming to put a dent in male domination of politics, at least at the local level, by securing a female majority in city assembly elections this July. \u201cSince I am the governor of this mega-city and hopefully the assembly will have a female majority, that will be a big change,\u201d Koike said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cSelecting as many women politicians as possible in the local assembly will surely make Tokyo change.\u201d In Australia\u2019s capital, the National Press Club hosted Kenyan educator and social activist Kakenya Ntaiya to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Ntaiya is the founder of the Kakenya Centre for Excellence, a boarding school for girls in Enoosaen. The centre requires as a condition of enrolment that girls are not subjected to genital mutilation or forced marriage. Ntaiya told the story of bargaining for her education at the age of seven, when she told her father she would submit to female genital mutilation if he would allow her to complete her education: I went through the cuts and it was a very horrifying experience. There is no anaesthesia when it\u2019s done, there is no medication, I bled, I fainted after that. I\u2019m very lucky that I\u2019m standing here today sharing my story. Many girls die. I was determined. I went back to school. She finished her education, won a scholarship to an American university (which involved another round of bargaining with the powerful men of her small Kenyan village), completed a PhD, and in the course of her studies, decided she would open a school in her village for 10 girls I arrived there and 100 girls showed up. It was not just the girls, it was their parents, it was their grandmothers, it was the people who really thirsted for an education. So my ten became 30. I have dreamed big. My girls are graduating this year. This year, 26 of them are finishing high school. They are going to university: this is the first time in my village that we are going to be sending 26 girls \u2013 not one woman, but 26 of them. That is the future of Kenya. Think about those girls. Some of them you might meet some day. Think about them as heads of banks. Think of them \u2013 that\u2019s their dream. They want to be doctors. Think about them as lawyers. Think about them making change in the whole world. That\u2019s why we stand here today to celebrate the progress we have made, by pushing ourselves to be bold, to move forward, to say it\u2019s time that women need to be there. Please don\u2019t wait to be handed over. We have to step forward. We have to be bold. On Monday night, on Australia\u2019s Q&amp;A debate show, Mei Fong, a journalist and author of a book on China\u2019s one-child policy, now based in Washington DC, said the ability to protest was \u201ca great privilege\u201d. Fong praised the regular protests in America\u2019s capital, \u201cthe heart of crazy Trumpland\u201d, adding: It is protests against the immigration ban, against mistreatment of women, and I bless my heart \u2013 it\u2019s so wonderful when I see people chant, holding up signs in the streets. You guys don\u2019t realise how wonderful it is to be able to get out there and not be tear-gassed. Two years ago, Li Maizi was imprisoned after she and four other young feminists attempted to mark International Women\u2019s Day in China. This year Li is spending International Women\u2019s Day in the UK where she spoke at Soas in London last night and will address the University of Nottingham tonight. She has also written for the Guardian about her treatment \u2013 and the treatment of women \u2013 in her home country: I often think of the day I was detained in Beijing. On the night of 6 March 2015, the police knocked on my door and took me to the station, where I was questioned nonstop for 24 hours. Later I was sent to a detention centre, where I was held for 37 days \u2026 Two years later, is there any hope for the Chinese feminist movement? Definitely, yes. Since my arrest, there has been both progress and a backlash against women\u2019s rights \u2026 Women are becoming more active in the fight against gender discrimination. When I was released from detention, I faced a tough decision: should I continue my activism, or give up? I chose to continue. What I do is for the rights of women all over the world. But I can\u2019t help but be especially concerned about China. My own experiences, and the experiences of my friends in China, have had a profound effect on me \u2026 Because of China\u2019s two-child policy, abortions are readily available. If you get pregnant with a third child, abortion is compulsory. But I don\u2019t see our free access to abortion as a sign of progress, as reproductive rights only apply to married women. If you are unmarried, it is illegal to give birth and you will face heavy fines. Some NGOs are calling on the government to grant single women their reproductive rights. Maxine Beneba Clarke, Emily Maguire and two recently deceased authors, Georgia Blain and Cory Taylor, are among six authors shortlisted for the 2016 Stella prize, celebrating female writers in Australia. The shortlisted books, announced on International Women\u2019s Day, are Between a Wolf and a Dog by Georgia Blain; The Hate Race by Maxine Beneba Clarke; Poum and Alexandre by Catherine de Saint Phalle; An Isolated Incident by Emily Maguire; The Museum of Modern Love by Heather Rose; and Dying: A Memoir by Cory Taylor. \u201cThe 2017 Stella prize shortlist celebrates books that combine extraordinary literary accomplishment with the social and familial reverberations of some of the most significant issues of our time: racism, violence against women, the aftermath of totalitarianism, the place of art in everyday life and the way we confront our individual mortality,\u201d said Brenda Walker, the chair of the judging panel. Staff at Australia\u2019s Fairfax media are holding a \u201cFairfax Sausage Fest\u201d to highlight the 23.2% pay gap in newspaper publishing. Journalists are donning their vintage finery \u2013 \u201cretro-grade dress up day\u201d \u2013 to tell management to stop living in the past and make women equal to men in terms of pay. Justin McCurry reports: The Korean Women\u2019s Association United is holding its annual Korean Women\u2019s Conference in Seoul today. The association says it is working \u201cfor the realisation of a democracy where everyone can enjoy equal basic citizenship rights regardless of gender, sexual orientation, origin or class\u201d. Despite the rapid economic growth South Korea has enjoyed since the end of the Korean war in 1953, the country\u2019s women still earn far less than their male counterparts. According to the Women In Work Index 2017 released by PricewaterhouseCoopers last month, the gender pay gap in South Korea was 36%, more than twice the average of 16 percent among OECD countries. That means South Korean women are, on average, paid 36% less than their male counterparts. The report said that if current pay trends persist, South Korean women will have to wait more than a century before their wages catch up with those of men, according to the Yonhap news agency. South Korea elected its first female president in late 2012 \u2013 the now-impeached Park Geun-hye - but gender disparity reigns in the country\u2019s national assembly, where just 17% of the the 300 members are women, according to a recent study. That is still the highest proportion of seats held by women in the assembly\u2019s history. Over 30 women\u2019s organisations in India will march in New Delhi today for the One Billion Rising march. The campaign started five years ago, on Valentine\u2019s day, and spread across 207 countries, as women marched together to end rape and sexual violence against women. In Delhi the march had a particular significance, as the city was still reeling after the horrific gang rape and murder of medical student Jyoti Singh. In 2012, after the details of Singh\u2019s case emerged, India burst into protest, with candlelight vigils, and protests across the country. The case paved the way for small victories, including a special court to fast-track rape cases in the country, and a greater awareness of the country\u2019s ingrained culture of violence against women. This year, One Billion Rising\u2019s campaigns are focusing on ending the exploitation of women. More than 1,000 women are expected to gather at the Rajiv Chowk metro station around 11am local time. After the demonstration, a forum to discuss the work of various women\u2019s organisations will be held. In Australia, Dr Mehreen Faruqi, an MP with Greens NSW and a high-profile campaigner for access to abortion, began International Women\u2019s Day with a breakfast for a few hundred women at NSW Parliament House. She became the first Muslim woman to join an Australian parliament in 2013, benefiting from the Greens\u2019 affirmative action policy in a seat that had been preselected for women. She said it concerned her that the Australian parliament\u2019s upper house had the lowest percentage of women of any in Australia: That really boggles my mind, I have to say. And being a woman of colour, there\u2019s hardly any diversity. That\u2019s kind of a challenge as you do feel a little bit lonely, in that space. She understood why a career in politics would not appeal to women, given both the isolation and the \u201cadversarial environment\u201d: You wouldn\u2019t believe how many women have said, \u2018good on you Mehreen, but I can\u2019t do it\u2019. Other parties needed to take \u201cserious action\u201d to make sure woman were selected for winnable spots, said Faruqi. Faruqi recently came under fire for her comments that there was \u201csystemic racism\u201d in Australia; a Liberal upper house MP said it was evidence that the Greens \u201csecretly loathe this wonderful country\u201d. She said, especially in the context of Australia\u2019s history, it was \u201cundeniable\u201d that there had been racism, though she loved it as she did Pakistan, her birth country. When she arrived in Australia she was made to feel quite welcome, she said, but that had changed in the last 10 to 15 years: The amount of racism and sexism women are facing, especially women of colour and Muslim women and those that wear a hijab that are easy to identify \u2013 I don\u2019t want us to go that way. I want us to be the best country possible, and that is respectful, multicultural and inclusive. But the first step towards that is to actually acknowledge that racism exists. Tokyo will host a women\u2019s march from 3pm local time today, Justin McCurry reports from Japan. \u201cWe have been inspired by the women\u2019s marches which took place around the world [in January], and with the wish to walk together on International Women\u2019s Day, decided to plan the following event and march,\u201d the organisers said on the event\u2019s Facebook page. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has had limited success in his \u201cwomenomics\u201d campaign to raise the profile of women in the workforce, a measure he says will boost economic growth and address the country\u2019s greying working-age population. While the proportion of working-age Japanese women with jobs has increased \u2013 at 66.7%, the rate is on a par with the US \u2013 many do poorly paid part-time or temporary jobs that critics say are contributing to a rise in poverty levels in the world\u2019s third-biggest economy. Although women are notoriously under-represented in Japanese boardrooms, the country\u2019s powerful \u2013 and male-dominated \u2013 business lobby, Keidanren, has just sent an all-female business lobby to the US, led by BT Japan president Haruno Yoshida. In Indonesia, a coalition of women\u2019s right groups will be staging a march from central Jakarta to the presidential palace to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Once in front of the palace, a diverse range of speakers will address the crowd, including female migrant workers \u2013 a group often subject to exploitation and abuse in the Middle East and across the region \u2013 as well as fisherwomen, female farmers and labourers, and victims of the recent and controversial riverside evictions in the capital. There will also be theatre and music performances, as well as a dance performance by transgender students. Organisers from the IWD action committee expect a turnout of around 2,000 people. The event follows a successful turnout for a planned Women\u2019s march just a few days ago, where hundreds dressed in pink and purple and took to the streets to demand equal rights for women. Several Indonesian women dressed in blood-stained kebayas, traditional Javanese blouses, led the march holding signs that showed how many women are victims of sexual abuse and are killed in fatal assaults each year. Initially inspired by the feminist movement that swept America after the election of Donald Trump, the Jakarta march on Saturday gave voice to the state of women\u2019s rights in Indonesia \u2013 a country where over recent years aspiring female police officers have been subject to virginity tests, and where FGM remains widespread. Papua New Guinea has for some time been considered one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman or child. Rates of family and sexual violence are at epidemic levels, but many organisations \u2013 at community, government, and international levels \u2013 have worked hard to address it. Ume Wainetti is the long-term coordinator of the PNG family and sexual violence action committee, and she says there have been great changes \u2013 hindered by a lack of follow-through and real support from the government. She tells the Guardian: At the end of last year we passed the [government] strategy on family and sexual violence, but we don\u2019t know if funding will be made available to implement it. We are screaming and shouting for things to be done but what support is being given for it is another matter. There is government support but no financial commitment. The fear of stigma and retribution continues to stop many women in violent relationships from seeking protection or assistance, Wainetti says, and there is a lack of services beyond the provincial level. About 85% of Papua New Guineans live in rural areas. However, Wainetti says there have been changes in community awareness, not just about the unacceptable levels of violence but also the place of women in the upper levels of leadership. The country goes to a national election in June. \u201cI\u2019m here at a meeting where 50 women are attending training, learning \u2013 if they win \u2013 how they will do in parliament and what is expected of them,\u201d says Wainetti. \u201cI have not really seen many women confirmed candidates.\u201d At the last election, there were three and she hopes 2017 will see more. \u201cWhether they have funding or party support to make it to parliament is another matter. There are changes but we still need to see some concrete support.\u201d Some of that support comes from international NGOs like MSF, ChildFund, and the Red Cross, as well as foreign governments. This morning Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, who is currently in PNG, announced AU$10m in grants to six international NGOs to deliver projects promoting the rights of women and girls in 12 developing countries, including PNG. Bishop said the Gender Action Platform projects \u201cwork to increase women\u2019s economic opportunities, improve women\u2019s participation in leadership, and reduce gender-based violence\u201d. Writing in Guardian Australia today, Greens NSW MP Mehreen Faruqi says the right for women to control their bodies is still under attack in Australia \u2013 not least by the continuing restrictions on access to abortion: So many people are shocked to discover that abortion is still a criminal offence in both Queensland and New South Wales. While medical practice has advanced and majority public opinion has shifted in support of a woman\u2019s right to choose, more than century-old laws remain unaltered in these two states \u2026 Many doctors do not perform this procedure owing to this risk of prosecution. Services are limited, privatised and expensive, creating barriers to access, especially for rural and regional women. It\u2019s not unusual to see intimidation of patients by anti-choice protesters picketing outside clinics with graphic images and even handing out plastic foetuses in an effort to shame them. This is what criminalisation has led to: shame and stigma. We must remove the shame and end the stigma. Today\u2019s Google doodle for IWD highlights the lives of 13 women, as told by a woman to her granddaughter as a bedtime story. All of the women featured, Google says, have previously featured in doodles of their own, but usually only within their home countries. The doodle shows the stories of American suffragist Ida Wells; Egyptian pilot Lotfia El Nadi; Mexican artist Frida Kahlo; Italian-born Brazilian architect Lina Bo Bardi; Soviet scientist Olga Skorokhodova; South African activist Miriam Makeba; American astronaut Sally Ride; the first Muslim woman to compete in the Olympics, Turkey\u2019s Halet \u00c7ambel; English computer pioneer Ada Lovelace; Indian dancer Rukmini Devi; Argentinian doctor Cecilia Grierson; Korea\u2019s first female lawyer and judge Lee Tai-young; and French tennis player Suzanne Lenglen. ABC News presenter Juanita Phillips has some advice for those perturbed by the Australian broadcaster\u2019s all-female line-up today: China \u2013 home to around 675 million women \u2013 is unlikely to witness much IWD action today. Two years ago, five feminists who were planning to put some stickers on buses to mark International Women\u2019s Day were locked up by authorities on suspicion of \u201cpicking quarrels and creating a disturbance\u201d. The women \u2013 Wei Tingting, Li Tingting (known as Li Maizi), Wu Rongrong, Wang Man and Zheng Churan (Datu) \u2013 were intending to distribute stickers with slogans such as \u201cPolice: go arrest those who committed sexual harassment\u201d. Just a fortnight ago, an account called \u201cFeminist Voice in China\u201d on social networking site Sina Weibo was banned for 30 days after it posted a Chinese translation of an article in which academics argued for a new \u201cmilitant feminist struggle\u201d against Donald Trump\u2019s policies, calling for an international women\u2019s strike today, 8 March. The article was first published in the Guardian: you can read it here. Xiong Jing, an editor for the Feminist Voice, said Weibo had not told the group the reason for the ban, but: We are guessing that it\u2019s because we sent out some tweets calling for a women\u2019s strike action against Trump. All day today across TV, radio and digital, Australia\u2019s ABC is celebrating International Women\u2019s Day with an all-female line-up. Women will take over from their male counterparts on programs they host from NewsRadio to ABC TV. News bulletins across the country and television programs will focus on telling women\u2019s stories. In a special IWD broadcast at 1pm, Radio National will revisit its groundbreaking women\u2019s show Coming Out with a special Coming Out, Again, which will reunite some of the Coming Out cast from the 70s to the 90s, such as Julie Rigg, Nicola Joseph, Fiona Martin and Kath Duncan. Mark Colvin\u2019s PM will instead be hosted by Kim Landers and Julia Zemiro\u2019s Home Delivery features social commentator Susan Carland. On ABC iview you can watch a collection of programs highlighting the work of women including artist Margaret Olley, journalist Ita Buttrose and comedian Judith Lucy. But Rupert Murdoch\u2019s stable was cranky with the ABC for devoting the day to celebrating women. A front page in the Daily Telegraph yesterday called it tokenism and a \u201cman ban\u201d. \u201cThe ABC will boot all of its male television and radio hosts off air tomorrow in a bizarre and patronising bid to promote \u2018gender equality\u2019,\u201d the Tele reported. The Australian soon jumped on the bandwagon, with not one but two pieces ridiculing the move: \u201cThe ABC in its wisdom is dumping its male presenters tomorrow in favour of an all female line-up.\u201d The ABC was forced to defend the initiative. International Women\u2019s Day is an opportunity for the ABC to draw attention to one of the great issues of the modern age. Gender parity is one of the biggest challenges facing the Australian, and the global, economy today. The #IWDABC line-up on International Women\u2019s Day represents one day of activity; however it sits within a broader ABC campaign focusing on equality and the recognition of women, and supporting the UN\u2019s #BeBoldForChange initiative. There are a bunch of happenings going on around Southeast Asia for International Women\u2019s Day, reports our correspondent Oliver Holmes. In Singapore, the iconic Vagina Monologues is on. The show started in New York two decades ago and has since been translated into nearly 50 languages to \u201cempower women and men, stimulate dialogue and support social causes such as ending violence against women\u201d. Tickets are sold out but you can jump on a waiting list here. A portion of the profit will go towards care packages covering food, medicine, sanitary napkins, infant formula and children uniforms for destitute women on the streets of Johor Bahr, in Malaysia. Also in the city state (and not sold out!) there is Queer Karaoke. It\u2019s billed as for feminists and pacifists \u201cpassionate about women\u2019s issues\u201d. Book here. In Myanmar, head to the lush People\u2019s Park at 4.30pm local for a celebration of art exhibitions, music, theatre and public readings. The organisers say there will be some \u201csurprises\u201d too. In Thailand, there is the \u201cHeForShe\u201d arts week Bangkok, run by UN Women and starting today. At the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre, there will be exhibits and performances, including from Thai-Australian video artist Kawita Vatanajyankur and Hong Kong-based graphic designer Cath Love. Also in Bangkok, a four-days film festival starts in SF Cinema Central World to showcase seven award-winning movies based on gender issues, including \u2018He Named Me Malala\u2019 and \u2018Dev Bhoomi\u2019. International Women\u2019s Day talks are being held across the Philippines, too: here and here and here. A key feature of 2017\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day is the call for \u201ca day without women\u201d \u2013 for women to take the day off work (paid and unpaid, at home and out of the home); to avoid shopping for the day, \u201cwith exceptions for small, women- and minority-owned businesses\u201d; to wear red in solidarity. In America, the call to strike has been led by the organisers of the Women\u2019s March, which took place across the US (and the world) the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration. A group of feminist activists and academics wrote recently in the Guardian about the need to strike: The idea is to mobilize women, including trans women, and all who support them in an international day of struggle \u2013 a day of striking, marching, blocking roads, bridges, and squares, abstaining from domestic, care and sex work, boycotting, calling out misogynistic politicians and companies, striking in educational institutions. These actions are aimed at making visible the needs and aspirations of those whom lean-in feminism ignored: women in the formal labor market, women working in the sphere of social reproduction and care, and unemployed and precarious working women. In embracing a feminism for the 99%, we take inspiration from the Argentinian coalition Ni Una Menos. Violence against women, as they define it, has many facets: it is domestic violence, but also the violence of the market, of debt, of capitalist property relations, and of the state; the violence of discriminatory policies against lesbian, trans and queer women; the violence of state criminalization of migratory movements; the violence of mass incarceration; and the institutional violence against women\u2019s bodies through abortion bans and lack of access to free healthcare and free abortion. But Guardian columnist Lindy West, speaking on Australian TV this week, while agreeing that \u201cprotest is most effective when it disrupts people\u2019s lives\u201d, echoed concerns of others who are cautious about the proposed strike: It would be tremendously effective if we could mobilise every single woman in the world \u2026 A concern for me, as a very privileged, financially stable white woman who works from home \u2026 it\u2019s very easy for me to say yes, everyone should go on strike but I want to be very cognisant of the fact there are very many women who cannot afford to lose one day\u2019s worth of pay, let alone risk their job. You can find details of strikes and other protests taking place around the world from Australia to Uruguay via the links on this page. Today, Margaret Carey \u2013 director of an early childhood centre in Sydney, Australia \u2013 is striking for the first time ever. She explains why: Women are an essential part of society. We hold together the household. We hold together the family. We care for our partners (though in a genuine relationship it is certainly not a one-way street). We care for our children. We care for others\u2019 children. We care for our parents as they grow older. And we fill the jobs equated with caring. In my sector, 97% of us are women. It is not because the work we do has no value. It is because the work we do has an intrinsic female association. \u2018Care\u2019 in any role should not be seen as of little value. If anything, it should be seen as value-adding to the role. Look at aged care workers, educators, nurses, teachers, social workers, psychologists, therapists, tutors, doctors. None of these professions are seen only as caring, but care is understood as intrinsic to their role. But it is we in early childhood who forever need to point out that we are the same: we do caring but our whole job is far more than that. I am walking off because I want the government and society to recognise that an early childhood educator is a professional role and one that must be given its deserved status. The first real step, a big step, in this direction is to receive professional wages, not 20 patronising dollars an hour. More of the globe is now ticking over into International Women\u2019s Day. Here\u2019s Lebanon\u2019s government palace in Beirut, illuminated purple for the day: In Mumbai, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus railway station has turned pink: When\u2019s International Men\u2019s Day? It\u2019s 19 November, since you ask. If you\u2019d like to hear more about how International Men\u2019s Day is on 19 November, can I suggest you follow comedian Richard Herring on Twitter, as he endures his annual feat of replying to all the people wondering when International Men\u2019s Day is. Here\u2019s what Herring wrote for the Guardian on International Men\u2019s Day in 2015: International Women\u2019s Day is on 8 March: 24 hours (of the 8,760 annually available) set aside to celebrate women and all of their achievements. And people get furious about it. Surely, you might think, you could only be cross about it because that definitely isn\u2019t enough time to celebrate the achievements of over than 50% of the population. But no \u2026 So for the last two International Women\u2019s Days I have tried to highlight this stupidity. I have got up early, logged on to Twitter and searched for the phrase \u201cinternational men\u2019s day\u201d, found every single person who has tweeted the question and responded to them all individually: \u201cIt\u2019s 19 November.\u201d There are thousands to get through. It goes on relentlessly, for hours and hours, but I try to get to them all because to see the same moronic question asked over and over again by people (who don\u2019t even think just to check Google to make sure they\u2019re not making an arse of themselves) is very funny, and shows exactly why an international women\u2019s day is necessary. Incidentally, nobody tweets me back to say: \u201cOh thanks for the information. I was wondering when it was.\u201d Almost like they don\u2019t want to know the answer to their own question. My hope is that if I can spend a day a year dealing with this issue, then that means that everyone else can get on with making International Women\u2019s Day about celebrating women and not complaining about the supposed raw deal men get. So I let men know that they do have a day if they want to celebrate themselves. Though not many of them do when it comes along, weirdly. Incorrect assumptions are still being made that gender equality has been achieved, despite disturbing and comprehensive evidence to the contrary, an investigation by Australia\u2019s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, has found. Her findings include the experiences of more than 1,000 women she interviewed while travelling to every state and territory over a six-month period last year to learn about Australia\u2019s progress towards gender equality. Women working in rural and remote areas were particularly vulnerable to inequality, Jenkins found. One young woman told her how she was asked to wear a bikini while fruit picking to get paid a bonus. Jenkins heard stories of women not being taken seriously or experiencing sexual harassment in these areas in particular. \u201cA lot of the rural women were really facing greater barriers to women in metro areas,\u201d she said. It\u2019s too easy to lump all women together as a homogenous group of white, Anglo-Saxon, heterosexual, able-bodied people, many who feel they are breaking down some of those barriers to equality. But there are many different voices in this, and my voice is tied to having spoken to rural women, LGBTI women, older women, women with disabilities, migrant women and Aboriginal women. Research shows that women with disabilities are 40% more likely than women without disabilities to be the victims of domestic violence; and that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are 32 times more likely to be admitted to hospital as a result of family violence-related assault than non-Indigenous women in Australia. The findings were launched today to coincide with international women\u2019s day. Jenkins said it was distressing to see the same arguments emerge each year that having a day for women was biased against men and unnecessary. Women from more than 40 countries are staging a strike from all work, paid and unpaid, to highlight women\u2019s power within global economies. But what if you can\u2019t join them? Here are other ways you can show solidarity, from wearing red to avoiding the shops for the day. New Zealand was the first country to give women the vote but gender equality is far from achieved. The pay gap is of particular concern, having remained steady at about 12% for the past decade. On current figures, it will be 45 years before New Zealand women are paid equally. That\u2019s even though the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1972 \u2013 it has never been enforced. Last month the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions launched the Treat Her Right campaign to lobby the government to take action on the issue of pay inequality. On Tuesday, the Ministry for Women released the findings of the first comprehensive study of the causes of the gender pay gap in New Zealand. It found that \u201chard to measure factors\u201d such as conscious and unconscious bias, and \u201cdifferences in choices and behaviours between men and women\u201d, accounted for 80% of the difference. For women on higher wages, the pay gap was significant and hard to explain; for women on lower incomes, factors such as type of work, family responsibilities, education and age remained important. In her first major speech since taking on the portfolio of minister for women, Paula Bennett said the difference in pay was \u201creally disappointing\u201d, and called on her audience \u2013 members of the Human Resource Institute of New Zealand \u2013 to take steps towards addressing it. She urged employers to remember three things: It\u2019s not about what you can get away with. It\u2019s not about what she is willing to accept. It\u2019s simply about you paying her what she is worth. Julia Gillard, former prime minister of Australia and current chair of the board of the Global Partnership for Education, writes today for Guardian Australia about the hidden women of International Women\u2019s Day: Considering that approximately 130 million girls worldwide are not attending primary through upper-secondary school and that women represent nearly two thirds of the world\u2019s illiterate, we must ask: How many other innovations and inventions \u2013 great and small \u2013 have been lost to the world because so many minds are idle on the sidelines of human progress? Today is set to be one of the most political International Women\u2019s Days in history, Alexandra Topping and Molly Redden report: From Thailand to Poland, the United States to Australia, the first Global Women\u2019s Strike will see action on both the industrial and domestic fronts, with participants keen to show solidarity with an energised global women\u2019s movement. \u201cWe are united, we are international \u2013 and we are everywhere,\u201d said Klementyna Suchanow, a Poland-based organiser of the Global Women\u2019s Strike, adding that the walkout would put governments and institutions under pressure by giving women a voice that has long been ignored. \u201cWe are an army of women across the globe and we are no longer asking to be listened to. The world is being forced to listen to us.\u201d The theme for 2017\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day \u2013 which celebrates the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women \u2013 is #BeBoldForChange. Organisers of the Global Women\u2019s Strike have joined forces with coordinators of the Women\u2019s March and hundreds of human rights and women\u2019s campaigners to capitalise on momentum in the movement in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election. Up to 2 million people around the world marched for equality in January the day after his inauguration. The Women\u2019s March \u2013 which now has organisers across 200 cities in 80 countries \u2013 has called on supporters not to engage in paid or unpaid labour and only spend money in small and female-owned businesses. Recognising that the poor financial situation and rigid work laws mean many will not be able to take part in a physical strike, organisers are urging supporters to wear red, a colour historically associated with the labour movement, in solidarity. In other countries women will wear black, or different colours, while the focus on issues from femicide to abortion will be decided in each nation. Hello from Sydney, where International Women\u2019s Day is up and running (and for readers still in Tuesday time zones: think of this as a bonus preview). We\u2019ll be covering the full day live from our offices in Sydney, London and New York; and with correspondents chipping in from all over the world. We\u2019ll be watching out for events, protests and stories of \u201c a day without women\u201d, as well as highlighting some of the key (and less key but just really, persistently irritating) issues that continue to thwart and hinder progress towards equality worldwide. We\u2019d also like to hear what\u2019s happening where you are \u2013 let me know in the comments below or find me on Twitter @Claire_Phipps.",

      "bodyText": "Liberal and Labor parliamentarians have failed to reach a consensus on banning foreign donations to political parties \u2013 with Labor now expected to reject curbs on activist groups such as GetUp. The joint parliamentary committee on electoral matters is due to bring forward an interim report on foreign donations on Friday after being given an extension of time in an attempt to build cross-party agreement. Guardian Australia understands there was preliminary agreement between the major parties on a working draft of the report late last week but the deal broke down last weekend. A copy of the working draft made its way to some activist groups, who were alarmed by the thrust of the recommendations, and intensified their lobbying efforts. Labor is now expected to produce a dissenting report, which will argue foreign citizens and entities should be banned from making donations to political parties and \u201cassociated entities\u201d, which includes some but not all trade unions \u2013 but will draw the line at extending the ban to activist groups. The Greens, who are also expected to issue a dissenting report, support a ban on overseas donations to political parties and associated entities but do not believe the ban should extend to activist groups. The Greens believe restrictions for activist groups should not apply before writs are issued because a blanket donations ban would harm groups including environmental, religious and public health groups taking part in civil society, including advocacy and delivering other programs outside election time. The Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm opposes a ban on foreign donations and peppered witnesses with questions suggesting there was no problem to be fixed. Other members of the committee believe he will issue a further dissenting report. Labor has been telegraphing concerns in recent weeks that the government wants to cross the line between regulating campaign finance for electioneering purposes and regulation that could be interpreted by the courts as curbing activism. Bruised by coordinated campaigns from progressive activist groups against the Coalition in marginal seats during the 2016 election \u2013 campaigns that supplemented a massive field operation from the ALP and trade unions \u2013 the government has signalled on several occasions it won\u2019t countenance reform of the donations and disclosure regime that applies only to political parties. The government has made the point that third-party activist groups are now significant players in the Australian political system, and you create an asymmetry if you regulate political parties but not other actors capable of influencing the political system. The special minister of state, Scott Ryan, told Guardian Australia last September: \u201cThere\u2019s no point regulating political parties to within an inch of their life and then saying it\u2019s a free-for-all elsewhere.\u201d Coalition sources have told Guardian Australia agreement has broken down through the joint committee process because Labor has been pursuing a \u201cGetUp exemption\u201d and that is unreasonable at a time where activist groups run overt political campaigns. The committee, which has been charged with reviewing the conduct of the 2016 federal election, and with looking at the donations and disclosure system, managed to produce a consensus report on authorising electoral messages in the first phase of the inquiry. If the government intends to pursue a proposal on foreign donations that Labor can\u2019t ultimately support, it will have to run the gauntlet of the crossbench.",

      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull has argued the case for budget repair is not just a fiscal imperative but a moral one, echoing Tony Abbott\u2019s argument from a year ago. As the government plans its May budget, the prime minister told a business summit that governments could not raise taxes while ignoring spending because future generations would pay. Turnbull said intergenerational reports had repeatedly warned spending must be more efficient to counter the costs of an ageing population. By 2035, there will only be 3.2 working age Australians for every person aged 65 and over, less than half the level there was in 1990, he said. \u201cBudget repair therefore is not just a fiscal imperative \u2013 it is a moral one,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cIs it right to say to our children and grandchildren that we expect them to pick up the tab for our spending?\u201d In February last year, Abbott described the same imperative in a Quadrant article five months after he lost the leadership. \u201cSo ensuring that government spends no more than it really must is not just an economic imperative; it\u2019s also a moral one,\u201d Abbott wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s the respect that government owes to taxpayers for whom every dollar is hard-earned.\u201d On Thursday, Turnbull said a strong budget was important to allow the country to weather external shocks from a position of strength. \u201cThe Howard government left us a fully paid up, first-rate insurance policy \u2013 large surpluses and money in the bank,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cBut Labor cashed in the policy, spent the inheritance, putting enormous strain on the AAA rating. That\u2019s Labor\u2019s fiscal legacy.\u201d Turnbull cited as evidence his government\u2019s attempts to phase out poorly targeted family tax benefits, payments that were introduced under John Howard and Peter Costello in last year of the Howard government. \u201cWe must make sure our spending is fair and fit for purpose,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cEnding compensation for a tax that no longer exists is fair. \u201cPhasing out poorly targeted family tax benefit supplements and reinvesting money into childcare and fortnightly family payments is fair. They were not popular calls to take to an election but they are the right ones.\u201d He attacked Labor for assuming it could keep real spending growth to 2% when it was growing at around 3.5% per year. \u201cI won\u2019t make promises I can\u2019t keep and I won\u2019t commit to spending money that simply isn\u2019t there,\u201d Turnbull said. Turnbull said the Coalition was focused on the need to innovate, making businesses more productive and competitive, including by lowering the company tax rate \u201cso we don\u2019t fall off the back of the pack\u201d. \u201cIt is not populist politics \u2013 it is the right call for the times,\u201d he said. And Turnbull repeated his call, first made when he announced he would challenge Abbott for the leadership, to respect the intelligence of Australians. \u201cPlaying on the fears and vulnerabilities of some Australians is reprehensible,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cIt is not an economic policy. And it inches us closer to losing our AAA rating. We must respect the intelligence of the Australian people.\u201d",

Dutton made the comments about the mooted department \u2013 which could put him in charge of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and Australian federal police \u2013 on Sydney\u2019s 2GB radio on Thursday. Fairfax Media first reported the proposal was under consideration on Tuesday. It is opposed by attorney general, George Brandis, but Malcolm Turnbull has so far refused to weigh in to speculation the government could create a mega-department by stripping the two agencies from the attorney general\u2019s portfolio. Dutton noted that the United Kingdom had the Home Office, and the United States had the Department of Homeland Security. He said the US had set up its department after the September 11 terrorist attacks \u201cbecause the intelligence agencies there were essentially operating in silos\u201d. \u201cFrom my perspective \u2013 we work well with the agencies, we want to make sure there are no silos, we want to make sure we are sharing all the intelligence and information. \u201cBecause it\u2019s part of the reason we can thwart these terrorist threats before they\u2019re realised,\u201d Dutton said. He said in cases where a person\u2019s immigration or security status was under investigation, \u201cyou necessarily want to get access to all of the information, whatever the government department holds on that person\u201d. \u201cWe just live in a very different age ... who can really predict what will happen over the next 10, 15 or 20 years in terms of security threats.\u201d Dutton said that Australia must \u201ccontinue world\u2019s best practice\u201d in intelligence-sharing with a \u201cmodern system\u201d. Asked about the proposed super department on Tuesday, Turnbull said he would not comment on \u201cspeculation about administrative arrangements\u201d. On Thursday Dutton noted that a homeland security department had been considered in Australia \u201cover a long period of time\u201d by different governments. He said he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of the process of deciding whether to create the department, and said it was \u201can issue for others\u201d. Sky News has reported that both Asio and the AFP oppose the proposed department of homeland security. Security and foreign affairs experts have lined up against the idea or questioned the need for it, including former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Peter Varghese, the executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Peter Jennings, and Ric Smith, a former defence department head and senior diplomat who led a review of domestic security in 2008. In that review, Smith concluded the restructure could \u201cdisrupt unduly the successful and effective work of the agencies concerned and create significant new costs\u201d. Far from breaking down silos, he concluded large organisations \u201ctend to be inward-looking, siloed and slow to adapt, and thus ill-suited to the dynamic security environment\u201d. When Labor floated the idea in 2008, Turnbull dismissed the idea as \u201cone gigantic super-bureaucracy\u201d. \u201cIt would have meant reinventing well-established patterns of cooperation and coordination between our key security agencies and confusing and complicating the existing practice of reporting lines within and between those agencies,\u201d he told parliament. Guardian Australia understands Brandis opposes the idea because there is good cooperation and exchange of information between Asio, the AFP and state police services, which have joint taskforces in major cities.",

With a remote-controlled snip of its cable, the latest robot sent into the bowels of one of Fukushima Daiichi\u2019s damaged reactors was cut loose, its progress stalled by lumps of fuel that overheated when the nuclear plant suffered a triple meltdown six years ago this week. As the 60cm-long Toshiba robot, equipped with a pair of cameras and sensors to gauge radiation levels was left to its fate last month, the plant\u2019s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), attempted to play down the failure of yet another reconnaissance mission to determine the exact location and condition of the melted fuel. Even though its mission had been aborted, the utility said, \u201cvaluable information was obtained which will help us determine the methods to eventually remove fuel debris\u201d. The Scorpion mishap, two hours into an exploration that was supposed to last 10 hours, underlined the scale and difficulty of decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi \u2013 an unprecedented undertaking one expert has described as \u201calmost beyond comprehension\u201d. Cleaning up the plant, scene of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl after it was struck by a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on the afternoon of 11 March 2011, is expected to take 30 to 40 years, at a cost Japan\u2019s trade and industry ministry recently estimated at 21.5tr yen ($189bn). The figure, which includes compensating tens of thousands of evacuees, is nearly double an estimate released three years ago. The tsunami killed almost 19,000 people, most of them in areas north of Fukushima, and forced 160,000 people living near the plant to flee their homes. Six years on, only a small number have returned to areas deemed safe by the authorities.

So much of what is communicated to the public and media is speculation and wishful thinking on the part of industry and government. \u201cThe current schedule for the removal of hundreds of tons of molten nuclear fuel, the location and condition of which they still have no real understanding, was based on the timetable of prime minister [Shinzo] Abe in Tokyo and the nuclear industry \u2013 not the reality on the ground and based on sound engineering and science.\u201d Even Shunichi Tanaka, the chairman of Japan\u2019s nuclear regulation authority, does not appear to share Tepco\u2019s optimism that it will stick to its decommissioning roadmap. \u201cIt is still early to talk in such an optimistic way,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the moment, we are still feeling around in the dark.\u201d \u2018The situation is not under control\u2019 On the surface, much has changed since the Guardian\u2019s first visit to Fukushima Daiichi five years ago. Then, the site was still strewn with tsunami wreckage. Hoses, pipes and building materials covered the ground, as thousands of workers braved high radiation levels to bring a semblance of order to the scene of a nuclear disaster. Six years later, damaged reactor buildings have been reinforced, and more than 1,300 spent fuel assemblies have been safely removed from a storage pool in reactor No 4. The ground has been covered with a special coating to prevent rainwater from adding to Tepco\u2019s water-management woes. Workers who once had to change into protective gear before they approached Fukushima Daiichi now wear light clothing and simple surgical masks in most areas of the plant. The 6,000 workers, including thousands of contract staff, can now eat hot meals and take breaks at a \u201crest house\u201d that opened in 2015. But further up the hill from the coastline, row upon row of steel tanks are a reminder of the decommissioning effort\u2019s other great nemesis: contaminated water. The tanks now hold about 900,000 tons of water, with the quantity soon expected to reach 1m tons. Tepco\u2019s once-vaunted underground ice wall, built at a cost of 24.5bn yen, has so far failed to completely prevent groundwater from leaking into the reactor basements and mixing with radioactive coolant water. The structure, which freezes the soil to a depth of 30 metres, is still allowing 150 tonnes of groundwater to seep into the reactor basements every day, said Yuichi Okamura, a Tepco spokesman. Five sections have been kept open deliberately to prevent water inside the reactor basements from rising and flowing out more rapidly. \u201cWe have to close the wall gradually,\u201d Okamura said. \u201cBy April we want to keep the influx of groundwater to about 100 tonnes a day, and to eliminate all contaminated water on the site by 2020.\u201d Critics of the clean-up note that 2020 is the year Tokyo is due to host the Olympics, having been awarded the Games after Abe assured the International Olympic Committee that Fukushima was \u201cunder control\u201d. Mitsuhiko Tanaka, a former Babcock-Hitachi nuclear engineer, accuses Abe and other government officials of playing down the severity of the decommissioning challenge in an attempt to win public support for the restart of nuclear reactors across the country. \u201cAbe said Fukushima was under control when he went overseas to promote the Tokyo Olympics, but he never said anything like that in Japan,\u201d says Tanaka. \u201cAnyone here could see that the situation was not under control. \u201cIf people of Abe\u2019s stature repeat something often enough, it becomes accepted as the truth.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A sharp drop in Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions at the end of last year came courtesy of a spike in renewable energy generation in a single month, according to a new study. Australia\u2019s emissions fell by 3.57m tonnes in the three months to December, putting them back on track to meet quarterly commitments made in Paris after a blowout the previous quarter. The fall is the largest for the quarter since the government began recording emissions in 2001. The report\u2019s authors said this was entirely due to record levels of hydro and wind generation in October. This brought emissions for the year to December to below the year to December 2015. But projected emissions for the December quarter were still 6.89m tonnes over levels demanded by scientifically based targets set by the government\u2019s Climate Change Authority. And, long term, the results show Australia is set to run more than 300m tonnes over what is required to meet its Paris targets in 2030. The analysis was produced by Ndevr Environmental, which analyses data for all Australia\u2019s major emissions sources and compares the results with the government\u2019s commitments made in Paris and the cuts recommended by the Climate Change Authority. It aims to produce a more timely account than the government\u2019s, which is six to nine months behind. In the four years to December 2016, Australia emitted 20.7% of its share of what the world can emit between 2013 and 2050 if it intends to maintain a good chance of keeping warming to below 2C. If Australia continues to emit carbon pollution at the average rate of the past year, it will spend its entire carbon budget by December 2031. Projected to the current second, the graphic shows how much of the carbon budget has been spent. Matt Drum, the managing director of Ndevr Environmental, said the figures showed renewable energy was \u201cthe only thing that\u2019s keeping us in the ballgame\u201d of meeting climate commitments. Wind power supplied 6.4% of all national electricity market generation in October. The contribution of hydro electricity was \u201cdue in big part to all the rainfall around the Snowy mountains catchment area in NSW, which saw NSW emissions intensity figures drop significantly\u201d, Drum said. With the electricity sector the largest and most variable factor in Australia\u2019s emissions, these October spikes in renewables were alone enough to drive the quarter \u201cunder the trajectory we need for Paris\u201d, he said. But Drum said this was likely an aberration, with the return to power sector reliance on black coal, particularly for NSW, set to push the trajectory up again over a summer with record temperatures across the east coast. \u201cWe\u2019re still churning through our carbon budget pretty quickly and, if you run a trend line from when we made our Paris commitment, we\u2019re still way over and getting further and further behind,\u201d Drum said. He said renewable energy was the single key factor driving down Australia\u2019s emissions profile, ironically at a time when the sector was under attack from the federal government. Coalition government figures have sought to blame renewables for blackouts in South Australia, despite others pointing to energy market failures. Government figures including the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, have attacked more ambitious state renewables targets as unfeasible and talked up the benefits of new coal-fired power stations and channelling \u201cclean energy\u201d funding towards them. Drum said the government was \u201cundermining the only policy lever that\u2019s having any impact on our emissions trajectory\u201d. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s keeping us in the ballgame at all is our renewable energy generation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis makes sense when there\u2019s no other feasible carbon policy on the table at the moment. ERF [the emissions reduction fund] isn\u2019t doing it. Direct Action more broadly isn\u2019t going anywhere near it \u2026 \u201cBut if they want to peel back renewables, there\u2019s nothing left.\u201d An independent review of the state of Australia\u2019s environment released on Monday found the impacts of climate change were increasing and some could be irreversible. The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, in a column for Guardian Australia, said the report \u201cmakes clear that, for the world to meet its Paris goals, there is much more to do\u201d. He noted carbon emissions per capita had declined from 24.1 tonnes in 2011 to 22.2 tonnes in 2015. But the report showed Australia needed to \u201cput in place a coordinated, comprehensive, well-resourced, long-term response\u201d or risk leaving \u201ca legacy to future generations that is inferior to the one we have inherited\u201d, Frydenberg said. Late last year the government began a review of its Direct Action climate policy, which has been widely criticised by experts as inadequate if Australia is to meet its Paris targets. Shortly afterwards Frydenberg was forced to rule out converting Direct Action to a form of carbon trading after an internal Coalition revolt. Many experts and institutional investors argue carbon trading would allow Australia to cut emissions in line with Paris commitments at the least cost to households and businesses. The carbon budget recommended by the Climate Change Authority, which it described as \u201cequitable and feasible\u201d, was never agreed to by the government but represents the authority\u2019s view of Australia\u2019s fair share if global warming is to be kept under 2C. Direct Action is the federal government\u2019s primary carbon reduction tool, which pays polluters to pollute less through a reverse auction \u2013 the emissions reduction fund. There is no evidence the emissions bought through that fund, now largely spent, reduce overall emissions and many of the emissions the government pays to avoid are unlikely to have occurred anyway.",

Ellis, who was widely seen as a rising star in the Labor ranks, announced her intention to step down in a letter to her Adelaide constituents on Thursday. In it the shadow minister for early childhood education, Tafe and vocational education said she believed Bill Shorten and Labor \u201ccan and should win the next election\u201d but she would be \u201cabsolutely miserable\u201d to miss family time with her son. Shorten has praised Ellis\u2019s 13 years of \u201coutstanding parliamentary service\u201d, labelling her a \u201ctrailblazer\u201d and a champion for education. Ellis held the education portfolio in the last term and held numerous ministries during the Rudd and Gillard governments, including youth, sport, early childhood education, the status of women, childcare and employment participation. She said the decision had been a hard one because she loved her job, and it was a privilege to represent the people of Adelaide. \u201cI would love to be able to play a key role in a federal government focused on the needs of the Australian public and working to improve our amazing country,\u201d she said. Ellis said her son, who had travelled with her to Canberra as a baby, was starting school and she couldn\u2019t \u201cbear the thought of spending at least 20 weeks of every year \u2026 away from him and the rest of my family\u201d. \u201cWhen I think about having to regularly miss things like his first day at school, his presentations at school assembly, a first sporting match or even just being there for him when he is sick and wants his mum, I know that it would make me absolutely miserable.\u201d Ellis was an advocate for higher pay for childcare workers and the restoration of years five and six of needs-based education funding agreements negotiated by the Gillard government. In October she called for a radical overhaul of childcare, including consideration of abandoning the current subsidy system in favour of universal childcare or the government directly purchasing childcare places. In a statement, Shorten said he would be sad to see Ellis go but respected her decision. Guardian Australia understands Ellis will step down from shadow cabinet and her portfolio in the near future. In addition to considerations of replacing Ellis with someone of the same sex and faction, Ellis\u2019s replacement is likely to be from a small state. Jockeying for Ellis\u2019s shadow cabinet position is underway, with fellow South Australian rightwinger Amanda Rishworth a strong contender. Elevation of a person from the ministry to shadow cabinet will create a further vacancy, which the right will not necessarily push to be filled by a woman, with Nick Champion a possibility for a shadow ministry. At a press conference in Adelaide with Shorten, Ellis said she would hate for her legacy to be sending a message that young women shouldn\u2019t aspire to enter federal parliament. \u201cUltimately, this is about what works for me and what works for my family,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a generalised reflection on the way it has to be for all women or for all parents. \u201cBut, I should say to any young women who are thinking about a career in politics, I would say go for it.\u201d Asked who should replace Ellis in Adelaide, Shorten said he hoped \u201cthat the Labor party in South Australia sends us another talented woman\u201d but did not comment on who could take her shadow cabinet position. Shorten said it had been a privilege to work with her and Labor wished her and her family \u201cevery happiness in the future\u201d. \u201cA champion for education \u2013 from early childhood to schools, skills and universities \u2013 Kate speaks with passion, understanding and experience, of how great education can transform lives and empower people to fulfil their potential.\u201d",
