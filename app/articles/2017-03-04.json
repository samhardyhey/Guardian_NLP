This year\u2019s celebration saw the first float devoted to queer Auslan-speakers and teachers, a debut for the transgender Indigenous \u2018sistagirls\u2019 of the Tiwi Islands, and demonstrated yet again that the night of Mardi Gras is blessed with a bit more weather luck than any other. The world-renowned pride parade for Australia\u2019s gay, lesbian, bisexual, intersex, trans and queer community wound its way through the streets of Sydney with 184 floats, 12,000 participants and hundreds of thousands on the sidelines. While last year Malcolm Turnbull made history as the first sitting prime minister to attend, this time he stayed away, citing \u201cother matters\u201d interstate. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, and the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, marched for their second and third times respectively. Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore, and local MP Alex Greenwich used the parade to push for marriage equality. Moore told the festival guide this year\u2019s march was \u201cas important as ever as we push to legislate equality through a free vote in parliament\u201d. Saturday\u2019s parade opened with floats dedicated to Australia\u2019s first nations and the \u201c78er\u2019s\u201d, the parade\u2019s foundational marchers whose night 39 years ago ended in police brutality. It also featured floats from HIV awareness and LGTI health organisation Acon, Rainbow Babies and Kids Australia, a fresco of George Michael as Jesus, the Women\u2019s AFL and the Gender Centre \u2013 which marched with the supportive parents of gender-diverse youth. The \u201cForce of Love\u201d float poked fun at Bill Leak\u2019s controversial \u201cWaffen SSM\u201d cartoon that drew parallels between marriage equality activists and Nazis. Auslan float organiser Karen told the Guardian through an interpreter that she had \u201cmarched in different groups a couple of different times, but this is the first time we\u2019ve titled one as Auslan Mardi Gras\u201d.

And yet the treasurer had to be careful not to appear too happy. </p> <p>While the economy grew by 3% in nominal terms in the December quarter \u2013 the third-best quarterly growth in 28 years! \u2013 the amount of money going to employees actually fell by 0.5%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/feb/26/sundays-arent-so-special-according-to-the-fair-work-commission\">Sundays aren't that special, right? Not according to the Fair Work Commission | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How out of whack is that? </p> <p>Since the ABS began measuring quarterly GDP figures in September 1959, nominal GDP has grown in a quarter by 3% or more 58 times, and not once in those 58 times has the total wages and salaries of employees also fallen. </p> <p>That is, not until the December quarter of 2016.</p> <p>Little wonder that Scott Morrison <a href=\"http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/transcript/023-2017/\">on Wednesday</a> was quick to note that \u201cwe must continue to remember that our growth cannot be taken for granted and is not being experienced by all Australians in all parts of the country in the same way\u201d. </p> <p>Of course, hanging over this result was the decision by the Fair Work Commission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/feb/26/sundays-arent-so-special-according-to-the-fair-work-commission\">to cut Sunday penalty rates</a>. </p> <p>The government \u2013 which is in favour of a reduction in penalty rates \u2013 would rather the decision had not been made the day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/23/with-record-low-wages-growth-workers-dont-need-anymore-flexibility\">record low wages growth</a> was announced and a week before it was found that the total amount of wages was falling at the same time that profits rose faster in one quarter than they have for 40 years. </p> <p>Even if the increase in profits occurred after a four-year run of weak profit growth, it made for a tough sell. </p> <p>But we should not believe that the disconnect between the big economic numbers and people\u2019s lives has just arrived. </p> <p>The latest <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/australia/economic-survey-australia.htm\">OECD report on Australia</a>, released on Friday, highlighted that inequality has been growing in Australia \u2013 even during the mining boom years.</p> <p>While most coverage of the OECD\u2019s report focussed on its warning about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/03/australian-housing-market-crash-could-lead-to-broader-downturn-oecd-warns\">a housing market collapse</a>, the report also warned of the danger of Australia\u2019s increasing levels of inequality.</p> <p>It noted that in the decade of the mining boom from 2004 to 2014 the income of the poorest quintile grew by just over 35% but the richest saw their income increase by 42%. In wealth terms the disparity is even greater.

      "bodyText": "If ever you needed evidence of the disconnect between the economic big picture and people\u2019s lives it came this week \u2013 a week in which the government was meekly trying to argue in support of the decision to cut Sunday penalty rates while at the same time dealing with the GDP figures that showed both strong economic growth and falling wages. It used to be so easy: the treasurer would tell a story about economic growth and everyone would agree that if you focus on growth good things will follow. But that narrative has been dealt a pretty strong blow since the GFC, and the latest GDP figures released this week were a perfect example. On first glance the figures suggest that the economy is doing very well \u2013 the quarterly growth of 1.1% is the second-best in four years. And yet the treasurer had to be careful not to appear too happy. While the economy grew by 3% in nominal terms in the December quarter \u2013 the third-best quarterly growth in 28 years! \u2013 the amount of money going to employees actually fell by 0.5%. How out of whack is that? Since the ABS began measuring quarterly GDP figures in September 1959, nominal GDP has grown in a quarter by 3% or more 58 times, and not once in those 58 times has the total wages and salaries of employees also fallen. That is, not until the December quarter of 2016. Little wonder that Scott Morrison on Wednesday was quick to note that \u201cwe must continue to remember that our growth cannot be taken for granted and is not being experienced by all Australians in all parts of the country in the same way\u201d. Of course, hanging over this result was the decision by the Fair Work Commission to cut Sunday penalty rates. The government \u2013 which is in favour of a reduction in penalty rates \u2013 would rather the decision had not been made the day after record low wages growth was announced and a week before it was found that the total amount of wages was falling at the same time that profits rose faster in one quarter than they have for 40 years. Even if the increase in profits occurred after a four-year run of weak profit growth, it made for a tough sell. But we should not believe that the disconnect between the big economic numbers and people\u2019s lives has just arrived. The latest OECD report on Australia, released on Friday, highlighted that inequality has been growing in Australia \u2013 even during the mining boom years. While most coverage of the OECD\u2019s report focussed on its warning about a housing market collapse, the report also warned of the danger of Australia\u2019s increasing levels of inequality. It noted that in the decade of the mining boom from 2004 to 2014 the income of the poorest quintile grew by just over 35% but the richest saw their income increase by 42%. In wealth terms the disparity is even greater. The wealth of the poorest quintile grew by less than 5%, while for the richest it surged nearly 40%. The report noted that in Australia \u201cinclusiveness has been eroded\u201d. It found that inequality since 2004 \u201chas been drifting up\u201d and that \u201chouseholds in upper income brackets have benefited disproportionally from Australia\u2019s long period of economic growth.\u201d When the economic tide is at flood level, that disproportion is easy to hide and is more likely to be forgiven \u2013 all boats appear to be rising. But when the tide goes out it is not hard to see those left in the mud. It was one reason why the OECD recommended the government \u201cavoid freezing welfare payouts as part of fiscal restraint so as to not compromise inclusiveness.\u201d But welfare is not the only issue \u2013 the wages of the poorest are also key. Since 2004 the wages of those working in accommodation and food services have risen by the least of any industry \u2013 just 38% compared with the average of 48% for all workers. Those in retail faired little better \u2013 wages up by 41.5% in that period. For the 2.1m workers in those industries \u2013 whether affected directly by the penalty rates decision or not (and all will be when new agreements are made that use the award rates as the benchmark) \u2013 there would be little joy to hear the economy in December grew faster than it has for four years. And Scott Morrison acknowledged this on Wednesday when he noted that \u201cas a government, we are extremely mindful of these differences\u201d. That mindfulness seemed mostly reflected in the government\u2019s response to the Fair Work Commission. Repeatedly in his press conference on Wednesday the treasurer refused to argue in favour of the case for cutting penalty rates, and yet tried to also suggest it would lead to greater employment. On Wednesday his standard response was that \u201cthe view expressed by the Fair Work Commission in coming to their view is their view\u201d. By the end of the week the best the government could do was suggest that while the decision would help small business employ more people, the reduction should be phased in over two to five years. It is clear the government will need to do better. It either has to embrace the decision or come up with an alternative. But the problem for the government is the argument for reduced penalty rates is bound within the old narrative \u2013 focus on reducing labour costs and increasing competiveness in order to drive economic growth. And yet this week we received a very clear demonstration that greater growth does not always translate to greater benefits for all workers.",

He then uses the crease to get off strike via a push to the sweeper at point. Renshaw has a couple to look at. Does well to the first, pushing behind point.

On reflection, I was probably trying to convince myself. It isn\u2019t Pune, but it shouldn\u2019t be shooting through the way it did from O\u2019Keefe\u2019s end before tea. </p> <p>In saying that, his dismissal of Nair on the cusp of the break was all to do with class. A lot was said about the left-armer\u2019s overspin during the week. That it was his main weapon at Shield level, and would be his main device on a flatter track here. In other words, not to expect him to turn it much on a flat one. </p> <p>That\u2019s exactly what did in the Indian number six, who to that point looked settled and set. A huge amount of overspin drew him forward with consecutive deliveries, the dip enough to do him in twice. The first just missed the off-stump, the second was taken tidily by Wade. Get in, Sokka. </p> <p>Lyon bowled with serious bounce and rip in his marathon spell. His deliveries barely left the shoebox. The reward was there, three wickets, including Kohli inexplicably a) leaving a ball turning into him and b) then referring it. It used to be said that Stuart Broad had the L\u2019Oreal DRS Rule: \u201cHe\u2019s worth it\u201d. The Indian captain\u2019s referral felt a bit that way. A terrible use of the technology. </p> <p>Between times, Rahane looked shocking until he departed. Where has the fluent fella from two summers ago in Australia gone? Local lad KL Rahul hasn\u2019t been his prettiest either, but unlike his colleagues, he\u2019s found a way to survive, looking better as the session went on. A fifth Test hundred is within his grasp. </p> <p>Okay. We\u2019re a few minutes away from the resumption so I\u2019ll leave it there. <a href=\"mailto:Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com\">Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com</a> is where you can hit me up for the last couple of hours.

If he and the bowlers can push this total up around 280, who knows what the pitch will do in the Australia\u2019s first innings and beyond? With him now is Ravi Ashwin, who is a genuine all-rounder, and what a fascinating two sessions of cricket we\u2019ve just seen. </p> <p>So Australia have the momentum, but not all of the advantage. I have a grim premonition about Australia\u2019s batting effort while it\u2019s turning like this. Taking you through the rest of the day will be Adam Collins, who should be stopping by soon.

Ashwin, meanwhile, looks like he\u2019s batting with a piece of rope as the ball turns sharply. Might I forward the theory that this pitch is going to be a real handful for the Australians to bat on?

      "bodyText": "Australia have negotiated the final hour of the day, and will resume tomorrow 149 behind. Yes, you are reading that correctly if having gone out without your phone for a few hours. Australia rolled India for 189. After tea, Nathan Lyon took five wickets after tea to rout the hosts for the third time in eight days. He finished with 8-for-50. They are the best figures for any foreign bowler in India. This is one of those days where the facts speak for themselves. Australia came here today needing a win to retain the trophy, but expectations significantly raised. They then lost the toss, on an expected road. It wasn\u2019t quite that, but Lyon pulled out a career-defining performance. The rest, one of the most memorable shifts in modern memory. I better dash to his press conference. Thanks for your company today. Signing off from Bangalore. Russ will be with you in the morning. Have a good night. 16th over (and Stumps): Australia 40-0 (Warner 23, Renshaw 15). Australia have won the last quarter hour here. Warner gets off strike at the first time of asking to point. He\u2019s cutting well here. Renshaw has the skills for this task, the bat as straight as ever, the tourists to stumps without losing a wicket. Phew. Let me catch my breath and make something of that? Back in a moment. 15th over: Australia 39-0 (Warner 22, Renshaw 15). The wondrous left-arm ortho will get six balls at them here. Warner elects to use his feet to meet the flight, and push hard when Jadeja is quicker through the air. He then uses the crease to get off strike via a push to the sweeper at point. Renshaw has a couple to look at. Does well to the first, pushing behind point. So it\u2019s Warner with one more to negotiate, and he again uses the crease with ease. This time for three. Five from it. Good over in the end. One to come. Ashwin will bowl it. 14th over: Australia 34-0 (Warner 18, Renshaw 14). Three to go. Warner gets a couple out to the on-side with no real risk. Less convincing off the inside edge. A single. Renshaw also gets one on the pads. Good batting, big boy. Then Warners the over down the ground for one. Much easier for the Australian pair in the shadow of stumps. And Jadeja is coming on! 13th over: Australia 29-0 (Warner 14, Renshaw 13). Umesh again. So, Virat seems determined to not give his best bowler a little trundle before stumps. Okay then. Warner grabs one off the hip early in the over before Renshaw does what he does best: leaves. Oh, and he\u2019s beaten with the last ball of the over, ruining my narrative for the set. But we\u2019ve come this far. 12th over: Australia 28-0 (Warner 13, Renshaw 13). Ashwin is the man most likely here. A Warner single puts the pressure on Renshaw. To each delivery he has a question to answer, each on the stumps. Except the one that beats him. Tough game. 11th over: Australia 27-0 (Warner 12, Renshaw 13). Why is Umesh back? He struggled early, and follows Ishant - who bowled very nicely - from the far end. Anyway, he gets the gong, not Jadeja, with six overs to go. And to be fair, beats Renshaw from around the wicket to begin. So I\u2019ll leave him alone. Then his a good length again, making a tough leave for the youngster. Four more leaves follow, but far more convincing. Make of that what you will this close to the end of play. Maiden. 10th over: Australia 27-0 (Warner 12, Renshaw 13). Ashwin doing his bit here. Plenty of flight to Warner, then pinging a couple in to Renshaw hoping to sneak another through to his pads. He\u2019s good enough to get bat on it around the corner though. Warner back in defence for the last couple. Good contest from both ends at the moment. 9th over: Australia 25-0 (Warner 11, Renshaw 12). Ishant doing a lot right, and rewarded with another over. Warner again in defence, the Indian quick changing his line a bit to attack the Australian\u2019s stumps as we near the end of day one. A push into the off-side gives Renshaw a couple to look at. The second of those, to end the over, beats him outside the off-stump! That\u2019s very hard to execute, moving the ball away from a left-hander from around the wicket. Quality fast bowling from the veteran. Yeah, I know he\u2019s only 28, but he\u2019s a veteran. 8th over: Australia 23-0 (Warner 10, Renshaw 11). Ashwin pins Renshaw back to begin, but he\u2019s back on the front foot down the ground shortly thereafter. Good cricket. Warner would be mindful of stumps, and consequentially plays conservatively rather than chancing his hand. Experienced campaigner over here, he\u2019ll want big Test runs here tomorrow. 7th over: Australia 22-0 (Warner 10, Renshaw 10). That is DROPPED! Warner gets lucky. Ishant misses out. Flays a drive to the gully region, Rahane dives but can\u2019t take it. Not sure the dive was required? Doesn\u2019t look great. Ishant to Renshaw now, and he\u2019s nearly taken his off-stump leaving! Just over the top. Plenty more where these are coming from: 6th over: Australia 19-0 (Warner 9, Renshaw 9). Virat is listening to me. Ashwin on from the Cathedral End in front of us here. And immediately gets the crowd up and about with two big LBW shouts against Renshaw. The first was just sliding. Some pressure on the captain to go upstairs, but finally he\u2019s learned to keep it in the holster. Only taken five innings. The second is closer by the looks. But again the captain declines the chance for a second look. Renshaw survives. 5th over: Australia 18-0 (Warner 8, Renshaw 9). Ishant stays on. Wonder how long before Virat just goes for broke and chucks on his two twirlers? Best shot he\u2019s got. Warner is defending, ducking, leaving, prodding. No real issues for him here. A single to the last ball ensures he\u2019ll retain the strike. 4th over: Australia 17-0 (Warner 7, Renshaw 9). Renshaw into it, steering through the cordon for four. I saw steer, it was probably more an edge. But he did it so easily, I\u2019ll give him the benefit of the doubt. Bouncer follows, of course. But Umesh isn\u2019t on his game here, overstepping later in the over. It\u2019s a bit frantic out there. 3rd over: Australia 10-0 (Warner 6, Renshaw 4). Predictably eventful once Renshaw gives Warner the strike. He\u2019s cut in half by Ishant. Under his bat, actually, watching it again. 2nd over: Australia 9-0 (Warner 6, Renshaw 3). Warner away. Short trash first up from Umesh, Warner doesn\u2019t miss out. A steered single puts Renshaw on strike. Not mucking around, our D Warner. Renshaw takes three from the pads, the way he does so well. Essentially Al Cook mk II the big Queenslander. I\u2019m just going to keep posting these kinds of tweets for a while. FYI. 1st over: Australia 1-0 (Warner 1, Renshaw 0). Righto. Australia bat now. Concentrate. Still cricket to be played. And play they will. Ishant Sharma has the ball, and Warner is away with a push. Renshaw is leaving close to his stumps, but he knows where they are. Lyon\u2019s 8/50 also the sixth best figures of all-time for an Australian, in case you were wondering. Australia have an hour to bat. Or 18 overs. I\u2019m not entirely sure, but I\u2019m in disbelief still. I never shy away from the fact that Nath was the club captain as a 21-year-old when I played at Wests UCCC in the ACT comp. So I never tire of his success. Such a wonderful story. And every time he overcomes an existential threat to his career - and there have been a few - it gets better. FIRST BALL! LYON HAS 8-FOR-50! INDIA ARE ALL OUT FOR 189! The best figures by an Australian against India. Ever! It was the most straightforward catch, short-leg Handscomb having very little work to do. Bloody hell! What a world! And he\u2019ll be on a hat-trick in the second dig. What is Rahul thinking! Trying to hit Lyon off a length over his head, but nowhere near it. It has rolled off the back of the bat to mid-off to mid-off where Renshaw makes no mistake. An otherwise controlled innings comes to an end. And Lyon has 7-for-50! Party on, Nath! 71st over: India 189-8 (Rahul 90, Umesh 0). Rahul wheels away in frustration and/or injury after driving O\u2019Keefe into the off-side after the tourist\u2019s failed review. He has a go at a reverse sweep next, but misses. Back to the manual, he cuts one to point. A single is taken, meaning Umesh has a couple of balls to look at. Rahul is on 90. He does his job, forward in defence in a vaguely convincing fashion. India really need a Starc-like effort from Pune here to see them through to stumps. Unlikely as that is. Very long way to the finish line. NOT OUT! Long way away from it. The parochial crowd like that, making plenty of noise for the first time in a while. Oh, the ball-tracking says it nearly hit middle stump. Survives that too. We\u2019re upstairs again! Smith isn\u2019t worried about having a pop at this, O\u2019Keefe wondering if Rahul top-edged a sweep. We\u2019ll see... 70th over: India 188-8 (Rahul 89, Umesh 0). Worth noting in all that, Rahul again took a single first ball of the over. Don\u2019t expect he will do that again if he fancies a ton, with only the fast bowlers left. Umesh is a legit no 11 coming in at no 10, so this might not take long with Lyon going as he is. For all that, he\u2019s able to prod his way to safety through four deliveries to end the over. Lyon\u2019s figures are 6-50 from 22 overs. An inside edge saves Jadeja according to snicko. But it was taken easily by Smith at slip. So he\u2019s gone! Lyon has six! What a performance. Around the wicket that just went on with the arm with plenty over overspin. He has done everything right today. What a performance. Lyon shout for LBW! Umpire Llong says no. Smith says \u201cnah, it is out, we\u2019ll go upstairs.\u201d Lyon likes it. Stand by! 69th over: India 187-7 (Rahul 88, Jadeja 3). Mitchell Starc back from the far end. He was getting some nice little reverse swing tail away from the right handers between lunch and tea. You could tell because he was hiding the ball in his right hand when running in until the delivery stride. He\u2019s up to that again here to begin the over, bowling to lefty Jadeja. He\u2019s really carving it back into the left-hander when he gets it right. But on the whole, not the most threatening set. He\u2019ll be back to rectify that shortly. 68th over: India 187-7 (Rahul 88, Jadeja 3). Lyon must have another coming soon. Absolutely all over Rahul, past his hip with a huge turning off-break. Beats everyone, including the \u2018keeper and leg-slip. Singles for each to the sweepers releases the pressure somewhere. Freddie means India here, but you can see his point. 67th over: India 181-7 (Rahul 87, Jadeja 2). Jadeja holding up his end of the bargain, racing through five dots to Jadeja after Rahul gives him the strike first ball. Lyon the man of the moment, after all. 66th over: India 180-7 (Rahul 86, Jadeja 2). It\u2019s nearly two in two balls! Jadeja lets it go and it isn\u2019t far from his stumps. By contrast, second ball he\u2019s cutting from his stumps; the way he got out in the second dig last week. Gotta get them however you can. Lyon has an eight-fa on the shelf here. His eighth 5fa in Tests. Gorgeous! Lyon has five! Another conventional offie\u2019s wicket, holding its line a fraction after plenty of flight. Due to the turn he has routinely got today, the Indian \u2018keeper had to play, but an edge was all he got. Smith did the rest. Easy as you like. 5-for-45. Five of the best. 65th over: India 177-6 (Rahul 85, Saha 1). O\u2019Keefe has no concerns throwing it up here, giving it a chance to turn as it did for him from the other end before tea. Rahul\u2019s most effective shot has been the tuck behind square, it gets him off strike early in the over. Saha is getting well forward to blunt any potential turn. 64th over: India 176-6 (Rahul 84, Saha 1). What is a good score here? A day ago, 500+ seemed the orthodoxy, given the track looked so flat. Not so much now. Lyon v Saha is a relatively tame affair, with the exception of the penultimate delivery that turns hard back into the right-hander when dropping the length back a bit. Maiden it is. Here are some highlights from earlier. 63rd over: India 176-6 (Rahul 84, Saha 1). Rahul then Saha take singles to long-off to begin the over. The former might need to get busy to reach three figures if his bowlers continue their form of last week. O\u2019Keefe mixes it up to Rahul for the remainder of the over, but nothing coming from it for either. 62nd over: India 174-6 (Rahul 83, Saha 0). Saha comes forward to negotiate the only ball he has before Lyon\u2019s over is done. Lyon came to this Test with a bowling average still in excess of 40 on this continent. Wonder what it\u2019ll be by the end of today? Such a clutch performance. Great catch by Warner at leg-slip! Ashwin didn\u2019t Lyon to get quite that much spin, pitching outside the off-stump it ripped across his body and collected the glove on the way through. Low take by Warner, after putting one down above his head of the same bowler earlier. But forget that, Australia in with a real show of bowling out India inside a day. What a brilliant performance from Nathan Lyon. He now has four. 61st over: India 172-5 (Rahul 82, Ashwin 6). Two around the corner for Rahul to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s first one after tea. He\u2019s back to the end where he bowled his first couple of frugal spells. It is called the BELM End. They make big, industrial machinery and are owned by the government. There you go, I\u2019ve taught you something. I personally like it better when there is a Football Stand End like at Northants. Anyway, I digress. SOK runs through this over in, I promise you, no more than 60 seconds. Rahul defending throughout. 60th over: India 170-5 (Rahul 80, Ashwin 6). Pleased to see that Nathan \u201cNathan\u201d Lyon is back into the attack, skipping away from us here at the Cathedral End. Singles to both Ashwin then KL Rahul gets the latter safely into the 80s. The tweaker gets one to spin back sharply to end the over. Afternoon, everyone. I invested a fair bit of time in that middle session trying to convince colleagues here at Bangalore that the track was pretty good. On reflection, I was probably trying to convince myself. It isn\u2019t Pune, but it shouldn\u2019t be shooting through the way it did from O\u2019Keefe\u2019s end before tea. In saying that, his dismissal of Nair on the cusp of the break was all to do with class. A lot was said about the left-armer\u2019s overspin during the week. That it was his main weapon at Shield level, and would be his main device on a flatter track here. In other words, not to expect him to turn it much on a flat one. That\u2019s exactly what did in the Indian number six, who to that point looked settled and set. A huge amount of overspin drew him forward with consecutive deliveries, the dip enough to do him in twice. The first just missed the off-stump, the second was taken tidily by Wade. Get in, Sokka. Lyon bowled with serious bounce and rip in his marathon spell. His deliveries barely left the shoebox. The reward was there, three wickets, including Kohli inexplicably a) leaving a ball turning into him and b) then referring it. It used to be said that Stuart Broad had the L\u2019Oreal DRS Rule: \u201cHe\u2019s worth it\u201d. The Indian captain\u2019s referral felt a bit that way. A terrible use of the technology. Between times, Rahane looked shocking until he departed. Where has the fluent fella from two summers ago in Australia gone? Local lad KL Rahul hasn\u2019t been his prettiest either, but unlike his colleagues, he\u2019s found a way to survive, looking better as the session went on. A fifth Test hundred is within his grasp. Okay. We\u2019re a few minutes away from the resumption so I\u2019ll leave it there. Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com is where you can hit me up for the last couple of hours. I\u2019m perfectly positioned behind the bowlers arm here, so hopefully my observations will hit the spot. @collinsadam for all the bantz. 59th over: India 168-5 (Rahul 79, Ashwin 5) In the context of what is happening around him, this innings could be the making of Lokesh Rahul, who continues to soldier on despite the chaos around him and goes to tea undefeated on 79. If he and the bowlers can push this total up around 280, who knows what the pitch will do in the Australia\u2019s first innings and beyond? With him now is Ravi Ashwin, who is a genuine all-rounder, and what a fascinating two sessions of cricket we\u2019ve just seen. So Australia have the momentum, but not all of the advantage. I have a grim premonition about Australia\u2019s batting effort while it\u2019s turning like this. Taking you through the rest of the day will be Adam Collins, who should be stopping by soon. Give him a warm welcome. 58th over: India 160-5 (Rahul 76, Ashwin o) Ravi Ashwin is the new man at the crease and there is plenty of spite in the contest right now; I think Rahul reckons O\u2019Keefe was a little overzealous in his wickets celebration, and he might have a bit of a point. Distracted, O\u2019Keefe fires four byes down the leg side and continues to jaw off at the Indian opener, who is not exactly a shrinking violet. Ashwin, meanwhile, looks like he\u2019s batting with a piece of rope as the ball turns sharply. Might I forward the theory that this pitch is going to be a real handful for the Australians to bat on? There are shades of the first Test already as balls spit out of the foot marks. What is going on? Now Karun Nair loses his head, charging down the pitch to O\u2019Keefe and missing a well-flighted delivery. Matthew Wade performers a much cleaner job of the rest than he did before and Nair, who\u2019d looked perfectly comfortable, is inexplicably gone. India are self-destructing here. 57th over: India 156-4 (Rahul 76, Karun Nair 26) Such is his difficulty getting any assistance from the pitch, Starc now comes around the wicket to Karun Nair but offers up another full toss to be whipped through leg for a boundary. He won\u2019t mind that as such. We all know he was going for the yorker. The bigger concern for Steve Smith is how well these batsmen are now turning the strike and refusing to allow the bowlers any rhythm. 56th over: India 148-4 (Rahul 73, Karun Nair 21) Steve O\u2019Keefe continues with his miserly straight ones, or not-so-straight in the case of his fourth, which is a little too short and offers Nair enough width to cut late and hard for a boundary. Nair is also beaten all ends up by one that does actually spin away from him, but it jagged so far off the surface it only really threatened Steve Smith at slip. 55th over: India 142-4 (Rahul 73, Karun Nair 15) Starc is slanting it across the right-handed batsmen, and for now they\u2019re disciplined enough to let them pass. Starc is not bringing it back in off the pitch, so perhaps he needs to straighten that line a little as he sets up for the yorker. We\u2019re edging close to the tea break now and India can ill-afford the loss of another wicket. 54th over: India 139-4 (Rahul 73, Karun Nair 12) A big section of Indian fans rise to their feet and start going wild here. Revealing a little of my current snack shortage, I will admit I assumed it was due to a tray of hot, delicious-looking samosas that were being carried into their vicinity, but they\u2019re just trying to get on TV. Rahul and Nair continue to turn the strike in a manner no other pairing has managed today. But that matters not. I now just want a samosa. 53rd over: India 135-4 (Rahul 71, Karun Nair 10) In a win for India, if we\u2019re being realistic, Mitchell Starc returns now. Karun Nair is straight after him, neatly clipping four to fine leg and then getting unlucky when a straight drive cannons into his partner. Another thing I like about Nair: just a subtle hint of pudgy midriff. Gives us all hope. In most other senses he\u2019s rock solid. 52nd over: India 131-4 (Rahul 71, Karun Nair 6) At the risk of speaking too soon for no less than the fifth time today, Karun Nair actually does look totally comfortable at the crease, and far more convincing than Rahane before him. Let\u2019s see if I\u2019ve just consigned him to the gallows with that mozz. 51st over: India 128-4 (Rahul 70, Karun Nair 4) Sunny Gavaskar\u2019s criticisms of Lokesh Rahul aren\u2019t quite as frequent now, because the Indian opener is the only who has truly dug in today. The Australians are all over Karun Nair and needling the rookie six at every opportunity, but if it\u2019s making him uncomfortable it doesn\u2019t show in his batting so far. 50th over: India 124-4 (Rahul 67, Karun Nair 3) Rahul and Nair are turning the strike well enough at the start of this new partnership, and the new man gets forward confidently to the buoyant Lyon. He\u2019s got a real battle on his hands in his return to the side. 49th over: India 121-4 (Rahul 65, Karun Nair 2) \u201cLast time I played this bloke...\u201d we hear the abrasive Matthew Wade say behind the stumps as Nair faces up, but then the audio cuts out, so we don\u2019t hear the end of what surely must have been a bon mot to rank with Jimmy Ormond\u2019s take-down of Mark Waugh (\u201cAt least I\u2019m the best player in my own family\u201d). But Nair gets off the mark with two from the bowling of O\u2019Keefe. \u201cEvery dog has their day when it comes to playing spin,\u201d says Matthew Hayden. Perhaps a Border Collie would do better than India right now. 48th over: India 119-4 (Rahul 65, Karun Nair 0) Karun Nair is the new man at the crease. He made 303 not out in his last Test knock. Even a third of that would do his team the world of good here, because Nathan Lyon is in the mood. Ajinkya Rahane has gone mad! What was he thinking there? The Indian No5 charges halfway down the wicket in search of another hefty blow and misses it, and he\u2019s so far down the pitch that not even a fumble and scramble from Matthew Wade behind the stumps can save him. He\u2019s stumped by a mile. Lyon has another! 47th over: India 118-3 (Rahul 65, Rahane 17) \u201cBowled!\u201d bellows Brett Lee now, abandoning any sense of objectivity and openly barracking for a Steve O\u2019Keefe wicket. He might burst through the glass if it happens. \u201cEvery ball is a brand new racing event,\u201d adds Matthew Hayden. \u201cYou just have to let it go.\u201d If you can translate that into English for me, answers on the back of an envelope and all that. O\u2019Keefe has 0-17 off 11 overs. 46th over: India 117-3 (Rahul 65, Rahane 16) Nathan Lyon continues to turn the ball sharply and with angular threat. Sitting in the sheds as that is happening is Virat Kohli. If looks could kill, he\u2019d be on a murder spree right now after falling cheaply. It\u2019s actually not Lyon\u2019s best over, to be honest. Four off it. 45th over: India 113-3 (Rahul 62, Rahane 15) Matthew Hayden is back, and he says the tension is now mounting, which is certainly true of my own state of mind at the very least. He reckons 350 is a par score in the first innings, and this like all of his utterings comes in the anguished cadence of a man dictating his bank pin code to mugger. Rahane meanwhile, burgles a boundary when he takes a full toss from O\u2019Keefe and biffs it through mid-on. You don\u2019t get many of those from SOK. 44th over: India 107-3 (Rahul 61, Rahane 9) Oh dear. Australia have David Warner at leg slip for Rahul, who duly sweeps it straight at him, but he shells the tough chance, getting his hands up in time but failing to make it stick in his right hand. Lyon really should have a third wicket here. There will be talk that it was a very hard chance, but you should be taking those at Test level. 43rd over: India 106-3 (Rahul 61, Rahane 9) O\u2019Keefe is into his ninth over now and with another maiden, he\u2019s only conceded 10 runs thusfar. It\u2019s really applying the squeeze at one end, and very sound partnership bowling. Meanwhile, I need an answer to the below: 42nd over: India 106-3 (Rahul 61, Rahane 9) It\u2019s an in-out field for Lyon, Michael Clarke points out, which genuinely is the kind of thing a special comments man should be telling you about. The Australian fieldsmen are all in catching positions, either in the deep or in close. Owing to that, Rahul is keeping it on the deck, where you can\u2019t get caught. It\u2019s a maiden over for Lyon. 41st over: India 106-3 (Rahul 61, Rahane 9) Twin spin? Probably. O\u2019Keefe comes back now to replace Hazlewood, and Rahane turns him for a single. I\u2019ll be honest: I\u2019d like for Rahane to make some runs here because he\u2019s a glorious player to watch when he finds his groove. 40th over: India 105-3 (Rahul 61, Rahane 8) India pass the hundred mark now but Nathan Lyon has both batsmen in a bit of bother here, and is producing a quite magnificent spell of spin bowling. Sunil Gavaskar is calling it \u201cbrilliant\u201d, and he\u2019s not a man given to undue praise for Australians. Right as I type that, Rahane pitter-patters down the track like Fred Astaire and hoists the spinner over cow for a boundary. Good one Sunny. 39th over: India 99-3 (Rahul 60, Rahane 3) \u201cThey\u2019re better than what they\u2019re playing like at the moment,\u201d is Michael Clarke\u2019s appraisal of India, and there is probably some truth to that. Virat Kohli can\u2019t keep getting out cheaply, for one. Lokesh Rahul, meanwhile, takes a ball that Hazlewood angles in to him and quite deliberately opens the face to edge it through gully for four. Earlier Clarke was begging the Indian opener to turn the strike more often, and here he does so, sort of: a single from the final ball. 38th over: India 94-3 (Rahul 55, Rahane 3) Another biiiiiig appeal from Lyon, who draws Rahane a long way forward and jags one back into his front pad, but when Umpire Llong turns it down it is the bowler himself who talks Steve Smith out of a review. The Australians are appealing like hyenas at the moment, I must tell you for the sake of balance. Calm down gents. 37th over: India 93-3 (Rahul 54, Rahane 3) Rahul gets a single to mid-off at the half-way mark of this Hazlewood over, but there\u2019s nowt else on offer for the batsmen as the burly paceman does his thing. I know I\u2019ve said it before, but he does present a challenge to the OBOer: how to explain all those dot balls in compelling terms without lying a little? Michael Clarke has replaced Matthew Hayden now, so I\u2019ll see what gems he\u2019s got for us. 36th over: India 92-3 (Rahul 53, Rahane 3) More trouble behind the sight screen now, as people wander around in front of it for reasons unknown. Rahane needs as few distractions as possible right now. Anil Kumble said before the Test that he\u2019s not playing for his spot, but there is plenty of pressure from the rest of the country nonetheless. 35th over: India 91-3 (Rahul 53, Rahane 3) Josh Hazlewood is back to replace Starc, and we\u2019re faced again with the possibility of a quite strange Indian collapse. This pair at the crease are handy, of course, and so is Karun Nair, but it fell away badly after that in Pune and there will be some nervous bowlers in the Indian change room right now. Hazlewood\u2019s over is tidy but Rahane looks comfortable. 34th over: India 89-3 (Rahul 52, Rahane 1) Overthrows to finish the over! It\u2019s all happening. Out-of-form Ajinkya Rahane is off the mark and Nathan Lyon is a genius. He\u2019s now removed Virat Kohli five times in Tests, drawing him level with Jimmy Anderson for that honour. Kohli departs! Sensational stuff from Nathan Lyon. That thing I said about taking him off? Clearly I was kidding. Here he has the Indian maestro shuffling across the crease in front of his stumps but Kohli inexplicably leaves it. It pitched outside the line of off stump and spun in at a decent rate but with no shot offered and contact coming in line with middle stump, it\u2019s about as out as you can get. Remarkable! Nathan Lyon has done it again. Three balls earlier Kohli hit a sublime cover drive for four. Now he looks a chump. Holy moly. This looked out, and Nigel Llong gave it, but we shall soon see. 33rd over: India 84-2 (Rahul 52, Kohli 8) Mindsets are art forms, Matthew Hayden tells us now. If that is true, mine whilst listening to this commentary is one of the paintings Gerhard Richter hated so much he burned it to a crisp. Mitchell Starc is still chugging in, but there is no masterpiece in this over. 32nd over: India 82-2 (Rahul 51, Kohli 7) With a flick to the leg side Lokesh Rahul now brings up his half-century from 105 deliveries. He\u2019s hit eight boundaries so far, and been prepared to bide his time to hit them. Both he and Kohli are handling Lyon very well now. Might be time for the old switcheroo to bring Steve O\u2019Keefe back. 31st over: India 79-2 (Rahul 49, Kohli 6) I know I shouldn\u2019t dwell on the commentary, dear readers, but there is something utterly maddening about listening to Matthew Hayden commentate a cricket game. It makes you wish you were reading one of his cookbooks. Throw Brett Lee into the mix and you start hoping for a padded cell. Virat Kohli, meanwhile, presses forward to Starc\u2019s final delivery of the over and lathers a quite sublime cover drive to the fence. This is going to be fun. 30th over: India 75-2 (Rahul 49, Kohli 2) Kohli strokes a single off Lyon to get off the mark and his most obsessive fans are almost fainting at the sheer magnificence of it all. \u201cThere is a crush of humanity in this country,\u201d says Matthew Hayden, which is a worrying way to start a sentence. Fear not, he adds that this is \u201cinfectious\u201d. He\u2019s off on one. Lyon, on the other hand, is not looking quite as threatening as before lunch, but the stakes and atmosphere are both slightly different now. 29th over: India 72-2 (Rahul 48, Kohli o) As Mitchell Starc returns, and the hostilities resume, the presence of Matthew Hayden and Brett Lee in the StarSports commentary box means that the conversation immediately turns to ... curry. We wouldn\u2019t stoop to such levels of content-padding on the OBO, but if you\u2019re interested I\u2019ve had to make do with some wasabi peas and a can of Pepsi Max: the choice of absolutely no generation. Starc bowls a maiden. He\u2019s probably just wolfed down a bowl of chia seeds and kale. 28th over: India 72-2 (Rahul 48, Kohli o) After a predictably rowdy reception from the Bangalore crowd, Virat Kohli glides out to the crease and faces up to Nathan Lyon, who claims an inside edge with the final ball of his over from before lunch. Tense. Not the greatest omen: Fox Sports are currently playing the Laxman-Dravid mega-partnership of 2001. Why? Whyyyyyyy? Fans of Michael Slater should look away now. In other news, much of India is about to grind to a halt as Virat Kohli arrives at the crease to bat. We\u2019re a few minutes away from the second session on day one. But...a word of warning You can never get too far ahead of yourself on Indian tours. Che Pujara is practically Nathan Lyon\u2019s bunny Nathan Lyon, take a bow That is a real drag for Pujara, but he won\u2019t be back after lunch as both sides now file off the ground. He goes for 17 and his side is 72-2, with Lokesh Rahul undefeated on 48 and Virat Kohli due in. Nathan Lyon gets the breakthrough to go with Mitch Starc\u2019s early dismissal of Abhinav Mukund. Nathan Lyon strikes! Oh dear, that is a disaster for Che Pujara, who was shielding his partner from the strike brilliantly in the closing stages of the session but from Nathan Lyon\u2019s penultimate delivery, gets an inside edge onto his leg and can\u2019t do anything to stop Peter Handscomb swooping on it at short leg. Perhaps he didn\u2019t deserve that, but Lyon is rewarded for a very handy spell of bowling and gets a crucial wicket for his side. 27th over: India 72-1 (Rahul 48, Pujara 17) The highlight of this over is a slow-motion, side-on replay of Che Pujara\u2019s forward defence to Mitchell Starc. It showcases how the Indian batsman can make even the most express pace look pedestrian, playing it late and comfortably. I wish I could do a single thing as well as that. Blimey. He also glances one down to fine leg off the last ball of the over to retain the strike. I wouldn\u2019t bet against that being an attempt to save impetuous Lokesh Rahul from himself in what might be the final over of the session. 26th over: India 71-1 (Rahul 48, Pujara 16) Pujara is on power-saving mode now, happy to play back and straight if Lyon is going to continue to look for big spin. There is nobody on the 45 so both batsmen are also happy to just flick it into that region when things get awkward, so Smith brings in a leg slip after the horse has bolted. There has been a bit of that today. 25th over: India 68-1 (Rahul 47, Pujara 14) Sunil Gavaskar is talking Lokesh Rahul down a bit here, but he\u2019s done pretty well so far this morning. With a little under 15 minutes until the break he\u2019s moving closer to a half-century and weathered a few probing spells. Full tosses help, too. Starc gives him one off the final delivery here and it\u2019s dispatched for a boundary. 24th over: India 64-1 (Rahul 43, Pujara 14) Lyon has a deep mid-wicket and long-on in place for Pujara, which seems ludicrously optimistic at this juncture. He\u2019s really given no indication he\u2019d like to start lofting them towards the stands. With some sharp turn from the off-spinner Pujara turns a lovely glance down to fine leg for one. Lyon is very unlucky a delivery later when a fuller one stays low and beats the outside edge, the stumps, and wicket-keeper Matthew Wade to dribble away for four byes. Wade might not want to look at that replay. 23rd over: India 58-1 (Rahul 42, Pujara 13) Mitchell Starc is the only wicket-taker so far in the first session and he returns now for one last burst before lunch. He\u2019s got a slip and two gullies for Rahul but no short leg or leg gully, which is proven as silly as suspected when Rahul bunts a short one into that region. What is Steve Smith not seeing her? Rahul has another stroke of luck when he lazily drives at a wide one outside off and the ensuing inside edge hits his pad and not the stumps. Maiden. Good one. 22nd over: India 58-1 (Rahul 42, Pujara 13) Who needs fortune cookies when you\u2019ve got me, eh? Nathan Lyon does indeed appear now to replace Steve O\u2019Keefe, and immediately there is sharper turn and bounce. In saying that, bounce and turn aren\u2019t much god when they\u2019re angling down leg side and allow Lokesh Rahul to paddle one over fine leg for four. Matthew Wade\u2019s first ten cries of \u201cNiiice Gary\u201d ring out across the world, which is a fair effort considering there are only six balls in the over. Lyon finishes it with an LBW shout, but he\u2019s dreamin\u2019. 21st over: India 52-1 (Rahul 38, Pujara 11) What would Mitchell Marsh\u2019s bowling be if it was a band? Badfinger? Snow Patrol? Ben &amp; Jason? I can\u2019t get as excited about it as Rod Marsh used to, I\u2019ll say that. At least it\u2019s normally tight. He\u2019s stump-to-stump again here but Rahul looks determined to see this through until lunch. 20th over: India 51-1 (Rahul 38, Pujara 11) O\u2019Keefe continues with his accurate straight ones, but the Indians are no longer jumping at shadows when the spinner wheels away, and it might be time to bring Nathan Lyon on in his place I reckon. We\u2019re half an hour from lunch and it\u2019s probably worth a try for something different. 19th over: India 49-1 (Rahul 37, Pujara 10) Mitch Marsh appears now for his first bowl of the game, and he gets some awkward bounce sending it down to Lokesh Rahul. At least with his first ball. The rest of it is pretty pedestrian, but he\u2019ll look to hassle and nag them into an error. 18th over: India 48-1 (Rahul 36, Pujara 10) This will mean nothing to non-Australian readers (though I suppose you can probably watch on YouTube, eventually), but on tonight\u2019s \u2018Cricket Legends\u2019 episode on Fox, the Australian cricket journalist Mike Coward is the guest. That should be a beauty. Coward\u2019s book \u2018Cricket Beyond the Bazaar\u2019 \u2013 about Australia\u2019s triumphs and disasters touring India and Pakistan \u2013 is a classic. Maiden for Steve O\u2019Keefe. 17th over: India 48-1 (Rahul 36, Pujara 10) Explaining that Handscomb drop, Matthew Hayden ponders whether \u201cthe gods\u201d are on Lokesh Rahul\u2019s side today. The half-volley gods certainly are for this Indian pair. Again Hazlewood over-pitches and this time Pujara cashes in, flicking him for a quite casual boundary. Another is squirted through point by Rahul. India were right up against it half an hour ago. Now they\u2019re profiting from their resilience. 16th over: India 38-1 (Rahul 31, Pujara 5) At the start of the over the biggest risk of a wicket right appears to be a run-out, as both batsmen have a moment of hesitancy when there is a clear single, but then Peter Handscomb drops Rahul at short cover and in bizarre scenes; he hadn\u2019t taken off the helmet he was wearing at silly point. Did it make a difference? Maybe. He dived to his left and got a hand to the drive, but it didn\u2019t stick. That grid system I was talking about: 15th over: India 34-1 (Rahul 29, Pujara 3) I\u2019ve been focusing on the cricket so far, but it bears mentioning that either side of this pitch, the square has been turned into a bizarre, eye-gashing grid system. Why? I\u2019ll try and find out, but it\u2019s not a pretty sight. You could build a wall in the middle and play Battleship on it. Anyway, again Rahul has pounced from the last delivery of the over when Hazlewood over-pitches and gets driven down the ground. 14th over: India 29-1 (Rahul 25, Pujara 2) Pujara gets his first single in a while to rotate the strike, glancing down to the 45 to pick up one, but both batsmen are still content to let O\u2019Keefe establish his own rhythm as drinks approach. I can\u2019t help but feel as though some of their predecessors might have gone on the attack by now. 13th over: India 28-1 (Rahul 25, Pujara 1) The home crowd has had so little to cheer in the last half-hour they go absolutely bonkers here when Rahul gently clips two runs through mid-wicket when Hazlewood strays onto his pads. He\u2019s a very neat and organised player, Rahul, but it\u2019s a wonder Australia didn\u2019t further explore the idea of roughing him up with the short ball. Against Starc he looked particularly susceptible. He deals far better with half-volleys, of that I\u2019m sure. Hazlewood offers one up to finish the over and Rahul smokes it between point and cover to get four. 12th over: India 21-1 (Rahul 19, Pujara 1) He isn\u2019t spinning it to a degree that can be picked up by current camera technology, but Steve O\u2019Keefe is angling and flighting the ball well and has a throaty appeal for leg before against Rahul to start this over. Had it turned, Rahul might have been in trouble, but it was likely sliding down leg and the Aussies decide not to review Nigel Llong\u2019s not out verdict. 11th over: India 21-1 (Rahul 19, Pujara 1) Starc has a rest after his first five-over spell, and Josh Hazlewood returns for another. The right-armer has changed ends but not his approach; to Pujara he\u2019s angling it in towards middle stump and looking for the LBW. Pujara drives slightly impatiently towards cover but can\u2019t pick the gap to Peter Handscomb\u2019s right. At the end of the over Pujara calls for new gloves. He can\u2019t buy a run, but it\u2019s sweaty work all the same. 10th over: India 20-1 (Rahul 18, Pujara 1) O\u2019Keefe keeps going at Che Pujara, who is perhaps a little deferential in this over. Might India end up playing the reputation the left-armer established in the first Test, rather than the actual ball? We\u2019re set for a nice little spell here to find out. 9th over: India 20-1 (Rahul 18, Pujara 1) Starc continues to search for that toe-crushing yorker, which means he\u2019s sending down the occasional full toss, but he\u2019s never less than a threat. He sends one across towards first slip with Lokesh Rahul on strike, and though the batsman leaves it easily enough, Starc shakes his head at him as though he\u2019s just been beaten all end\u2019s up. \u201cHe\u2019s such a lovely guy off the field,\u201d Brett Lee says of Starc. More of those insights as they\u2019re at hand. 8th over: India 20-1 (Rahul 18, Pujara 1) Spin time! Hazlewood cools his jets a while and Pune Test hero Steve O\u2019Keefe comes into the attack for his first bowl of the game. His Test figures leading into this encounter: 5 Tests, 26 wickets at 20.34. He\u2019s wheeling away to Che Pujara first up, and the Indian No3 gets after him immediately, driving twice to cover and getting off the mark with the second, which brings a single. Lokesh Rahul is not quite as convincing when he skips down the track and flicks towards leg. We could have a nice little battle here. 7th over: India 18-1 (Rahul 17, Pujara 0) Starc slings a rising bouncer down the leg side and though it draws no comment from the commentators, Matthew Wade does a helluva good job to dive to his left and save it. It was fizzing away for a certain boundary otherwise. A leg bye brings the first run not belonging to Lokesh Rahul, and Starc goes after the latter with the old one-two of a bouncer and a yorker. Rahul gets an inside edge from the latter and it trickles through mid-wicket for a couple. He was biffing them through cover in the first over. It\u2019s a little harder graft now. 6th over: India 15-1 (Rahul 15, Pujara 0) Hazlewood is wobbling it down at decent pace too, but zeroes in on Rahul\u2019s front pad, applying his pressure with a monotonous, stump-to-stump line. It\u2019s another maiden, and with that, it\u2019s time to bask in some sweet memories... 5th over: India 15-1 (Rahul 15, Pujara 0) Starc chooses to slide them across Pujara to start with, probing away outside off stump and trying to draw him forward to glide. There are two slips and a short leg in place, and Pujara is his normal unflappable self, squinting into the sun between deliveries, then dropping his wrists and swaying out of the way when the short one comes through at 147kmph. \u201cThis is the difference between a strike bowler and one who just contains,\u201d says Matthew Hayden, responding to a non-existent suggestion that Starc bowls with anything other than express pace. Right on Starc finishes the over with a devilish bouncer, which cracks into the upper splice of Pujara\u2019s bat. Did I say he looked unflappable? Might have to revise that down a little. 4th over: India 15-1 (Rahul 15, Pujara 0) No third slip for Halzewood either, though he might not have saved a boundary that flies through that region from Rahul\u2019s outside edge. That is the only damage for the over in what is looking like a testing little session for both batsmen. Both bowlers have hit a decent early rhythm and Starc\u2019s yorker is working. That\u2019s never fun to face. 3rd over: India 11-1 (Rahul 11, Pujara 0) Cheteshwar Pujara is the new man at the crease now. He has one delivery to face and keeps out a yorker. Of interest before Starc\u2019s wicket: only seven balls into his spell he lost his third slip, who moved across to extra cover. A tad pessimistic in the first 15 minutes of play? Either way, Rahul really doesn\u2019t look comfortable when it\u2019s short and angled at him from over the wicket. I\u2019d be getting a leg gully in position pronto, personally. Mukund departs! Oh dear, that\u2019s an absolute shocker. It might have been heading marginally down leg, but being that it was a full toss from Starc and struck the opener\u2019s front pad on the full, the umpire had no choice. Mukund consults with his partner, but he probably knows the answer before it\u2019s given. Off he trudges for a duck in his first Test in six years. Sad! 2nd over: India 10-0 (Rahul 10, Mukund 0) Abhinav Mukund is a little more circumspect than his partner as Josh Hazlewood wheels away. In ten Test innings so far the Indian opener has managed only the single half-century, and the last of those appearances was in August 2011, so he\u2019ll be desperate to impress. India have played 56 Tests since Mukund\u2019s last, a statistical category in which he trails only Parthiv Patel (83), whose career was put on indefinite hiatus by the rise of M.S. Dhoni. Mukund is watchful to start with, and misses an opportunity to turn a pressure-relieving single down to fine leg. It\u2019s a maiden for the Haze. 1st over: India 10-0 (Rahul 10, Mukund 0) Mitchell Starc grabs the new ball for the Australians, stops at the end of his run-up and arcs his back into one final stretch to loosen up. Richard Illlingworth and Nigel Llong are our umpires for this game and they\u2019re called into action before has been bowled, because some buffoon is moving around beside the sight screen. The wait is worthwhile for Lokesh Rahul, who leans forward to a half-volley and caresses it through cover for a boundary. Take that, Mitch. Starc\u2019s penultimate delivery is a bouncer to Rahul\u2019s throat but he gets an awkwardly thrust bat to it, and then slices a controlled outside edge through gully to finish the over with another boundary. Stat attack! This is a bit mad, really. But India have never been big on sticking with an opening combination for long, with so many versatile batsmen sliding around the order. News at the ground: the anthems are grinding away now, and we\u2019ll have play in a couple of minutes. Ahh, the soothing sight of Ryan Harris There is something incredibly calming about the former Australian paceman\u2019s presence, though sadly he won\u2019t be opening the bowling today. He\u2019s sitting in the Fox Sports studio and says fast bowlers get very excited indeed by the sight of \u201clive grass\u201d on the pitch, which is what we\u2019ve got here. Whatever floats your boat. I sense that things will get bleak for the Aussies if they can\u2019t strike while the ball is still moving around a bit. What can we expect from Virat Kohli today, once he\u2019s in? For help I have just made contact with a mystical realm via a randomly-generated internet fortune cookie. The reading: \u201cPay attention to your family. Don\u2019t take them for granted.\u201d Sorry Virat, I\u2019ve no idea how many runs you\u2019ll make today but thanks for the reminder I need to call my Mum. Readers, give it a go and tell me whatever advice you get that might pertain to this match. \u201cIt looks like a good track to bat on, so we\u2019d like to put some big runs on the board.,\u201d says Kohli. \u201cThe guys are going to come out with much more intent in this game.\u201d Murali Vijay is out with injury and Abhinav Mukund comes in for him, while spinner Jayant Yadav is dropped for an extra batsman: Karun Nair, the 25-year-old who made 303 not out in his last Test innings. That\u2019s a fairly handy \u201cin\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be important to score big first innings runs,\u201d says Steve Smith, who adds that early wickets are crucial. Stuff we don\u2019t already know is thin on the ground. He\u2019s not giving much away, but clearly would have preferred to bat. India: L Rahul, A Mukund, C Pujara, V Kohli, A Rahane, K Nair, R Ashwin, W Saha, R Jadeja, U Yadav, I Sharma Preamble Hello all and welcome to day one of the second Test in Bangalore, in which Australia will be looking to extend their dominance of Pune but are likely to face a much sterner challenge from the chastened home side. Russell Jackson here to take you through the first two sessions, and Adam Collins will make an appearance later with the old ball. News out of Bangalore today is that the pitch will be a belter to bat on, which is hardly surprising after the three-day calamity India endured in the first Test. There is some moisture in the surface, but it should dry out and flatten nicely for the batsmen to fill their boots; great for Virat Kohli and Steve Smith enthusiasts, possibly not so much for fans of challenging Test cricket. But we don\u2019t want to jump the gun. Team news: Australian have named an unchanged eleven for this encounter, again not so surprising, even if Mitch Marsh is under a decent amount of pressure to produce something compelling. The tourists have stuck with their winning formula, but India might tweak it losing one, though we have no confirmation yet. Australia: Warner, Renshaw, Smith (captain), S Marsh, Handscomb, M Marsh, Wade, Starc, O\u2019Keefe, Lyon, Hazlewood Russell will be here shortly. In the meantime, check out Adam Collins\u2019 take on what Australia is likely to face after India\u2019s humbling loss in Pune.",

The tropical low, above the warm waters of the Arafura Sea, is producing gusts up to 85km an hour, and is moving south at 12km an hour. The bureau has put the chances of it becoming Cyclone Blanche at more than 50% on Sunday or Monday. On Saturday morning, a cyclone warning \u2013 issued when coastal and island areas are likely to experience gale force winds within 24 hours \u2013 was declared between the Tiwi Islands and Croker Island, just east of the Coburg Peninsula. A warning to expect those conditions within 24 to 48 hours has been issued for areas from Point Stuart to the WA border, including Darwin and Wadeye. The system is expected to track in a southwesterly direction and move closer to Darwin on Sunday. It is forecast to be close to tropical cyclone intensity as it approaches the Tiwi Islands on Saturday night with gales of up to 110km an hour. \u201cThe low is expected to move towards the south or southwest during the weekend and may form into a tropical cyclone near the Tiwi Islands on Sunday,\u201d the bureau said. \u201cThe cyclone may intensify further during Sunday night or Monday as it move towards the south or southwest across the Timor Sea.

A strong wind warning has been issued for the Tiwi and Arafura coasts on Saturday and Darwin harbour on Sunday, and a gale force winds warning for Beagle Bonaparte Coast, North Tiwi Coast, Van Diemen Gulf and Arafura Coast on Sunday. The Northern Territory and northern WA region have experienced record-breaking rains over the wet season. The weather system is expected to bring heavy rainfall of 200 to 300mm in some areas, exceeding a wet season total of two metres for the first time in six years, after Cyclone Carlos in 2011. The Australian cyclone season has had just two named storms: Yvette in December and Alfred last month. Both reached category one strength. Yvette hit the northern WA region and Alfred formed in the Gulf of Carpentaria. No cyclones affected the Northern Territory last year, but remote communities of Arnhem Land are still rebuilding after the destructive Lam, and then Nathan just weeks later, destroyed hundreds of homes in 2015.
