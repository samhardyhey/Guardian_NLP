Thousands of herders \u2013 some armed with spears, others with AK47s \u2013 have invaded private ranches and wildlife parks with their livestock, slaughtering animals and destroying property in Laikipia, as they go in search of pasture in the drought stricken-country. Tristan Voorspuy, a British citizen who was born in South Africa, had gone to inspect damage on his Sosian ranch, 190km (118m) north of Nairobi, caused by the raiders when he was killed. Local media reported that two cottages on his property had been torched. \u201cIt is true the Sosian ranch director was shot dead while going to inspect damage at his ranch,\u201d local government official Jacob Endung said \u201cHe was riding on his horse when he was felled by bullets. Even the horse was also shot at and is lying there.\u201d He said police had been unable to access the area due to the high number of the raiders but had managed to fly over the area and saw the body. \u201cThese people are dangerous, they don\u2019t spare anyone,\u201d he said. Voorspuy spent three years in the British army before moving to Kenya and founding a company specialising in horseback safaris, according to his website. He and several other shareholders also restored the once derelict Sosian ranch. Martin Evans, chairman of the Laikipia Farmers Association, said Voorspuy had been a shareholder in Sosian Ranch for more than 15 years and \u201cwent to look at the house of a fellow director and friend that had been burnt by invading and well-armed \u2018pastoralists\u2019 on Friday.\u201d When he didn\u2019t return by Sunday afternoon, an aerial search spotted Voorspuy\u2019s injured horse but didn\u2019t catch sight of the rancher, Evans said.

Elephants, lion, buffalo and zebra have been slaughtered by the herders who come with tens of thousands of livestock, and black and white landowners alike speak of invasions, fear and siege. The reasons behind the invasions are complex. Some officials have blamed the land invasions on a severe drought that has made poor herders desperate, and the UN humanitarian chief has appealed for assistance for herders affected by what Kenya\u2019s government has declared a natural disaster. Ranchers, however, say the land invasions are politically motivated and part of plans to take over their land. While some point to the drought gripping the country, and a spike in human and livestock populations, others say the looming election in August and long-running land gripes have sparked tensions. The government has done little to stop the invasions and with elections around the corner, few expect vote-costing action against the illegal grazers.

And it\u2019s happening under the shield of one of the country\u2019s most impressive public initiatives. The tragedy is the privatisation of public disability support care, which is impacting families of the profoundly disabled that have entrusted their relatives to this high-quality care system for decades. The initiative being used by state governments as a distraction to privatise government services is the NDIS, a scheme that greatly benefits many with a disability but removes choice for others \u2013 putting an enormous strain on those who need support the most. How could this be, you ask yourself? Surely if these words were true, you\u2019d have heard about it. But these families are used to adapting to tough circumstances: they\u2019ve been coping without fuss for a long time. Now they\u2019re starting to speak up.

The major contributing factors in all of the electrical fires were the age of the assets and the reduction in inspection timeliness and quality.\u201d This is an industry quoted as making $2.7bn in profits while reliability and quality have significantly declined. Recent blackouts in South Australia too were attributed to the decisions of the private operator to withhold supply in in the face of high prices rather than a failure of sustainable power generation. The inquiry also heard that both the Singapore and Chinese Governments, as majority owners of distribution companies in Victoria, have stipulated that the purpose of owning Victoria\u2019s assets is to use the profits to subsidise their national networks, helping keep cost of electricity low in China and Singapore.

India fought hard, didn\u2019t let the scoring get out of control, but couldn\u2019t snap up wickets quickly enough.</p> <p>The visiting side came into today with 40 on the board and no wickets down. Warner and Renshaw pushed on to another 50 opening stand before the more dashing of the pair was dismissed for 33, bowler by an Ashwin pearler. Smith played a long innings for not many, gone just before lunch, then Renshaw and Shaun Marsh dug in for another 50 stand.</p> <p>Renshaw eventually fell after suddenly deciding to try to hit sixes, his 60 from 196 balls, but more importantly his second important half-century in three innings in India. Handscomb was breezy but went quickly, Mitchell Marsh got a horrible ball that kept very low, and five were down by tea. But then it was another fifty partnership involving the elder Marsh that took Australia past India\u2019s total, and the match interestingly poised by the time he was out.</p> <p>Now we have Australia 48 up, with the chance to breeze past a lead of 100 with some Starc hitting tomorrow morning, or a chance to fall quickly to a rejuvenated Indian bowling attack for a lead of 60. Then it will be down to India to produce a good batting performance for the first time in the series, to try to set Australia some sort of chase.</p> <p>We\u2019ll be back here with you for that tomorrow, via the auspices of Russell Jackson. Until then, goodnight, afternoon, or morning from Geoff Lemon.<br /></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-05T11:17:08.549Z\">at 11.17am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58bbeff0e4b09c1763ef6564\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-05T11:03:50.683Z\">11.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>106th over: Australia 237-6 (Wade 25, Starc 14)<br /></strong></p> <p>Starc to face the last over.

The 200 comes up with a Marsh single.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eld2_0/status/838331271671496707\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The evidence is back, and once again, Wade ain&#39;t gloved shit. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/INDvAUS?src=hash\">#INDvAUS</a></p>&mdash; Dane (@eld2_0) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eld2_0/status/838331271671496707\">March 5, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-05T10:19:06.668Z\">at 10.19am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58bbe1c0e4b09c1763ef6537\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-05T10:06:21.220Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>93rd over: Australia 194-5 (S Marsh 55, Wade 12)<br /></strong></p> <p>Edging up to drinks, and just a couple more runs from Ishant\u2019s 21st over as Marsh plays a stylish cut shot away behind point.

Using the bat is probably the way to go.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-05T04:49:42.437Z\">at 4.49am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58bb961ae4b09c1763ef6433\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-05T04:42:48.150Z\">4.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>25th over: Australia 54-1 (Renshaw 16, Smith 2)</strong></p> <p>Tense times call for tough characters, and Steve Smith\u2019s narrow-eyed focus is abundantly clear as he faces up to Ishant.

He\u2019s got a gully, a leg slip and short leg for Warner, and pursues a leg-side line in the hope the left-hander will do something rash. To start with Warner just pads up, but when Ashwin straightens just a fraction, a huge off-break goes fizzing past the outside edge of his forward defence. That was a jaffa. Matt Renshaw probably gulps at the other end.

India fought hard, didn\u2019t let the scoring get out of control, but couldn\u2019t snap up wickets quickly enough. The visiting side came into today with 40 on the board and no wickets down. Warner and Renshaw pushed on to another 50 opening stand before the more dashing of the pair was dismissed for 33, bowler by an Ashwin pearler. Smith played a long innings for not many, gone just before lunch, then Renshaw and Shaun Marsh dug in for another 50 stand. Renshaw eventually fell after suddenly deciding to try to hit sixes, his 60 from 196 balls, but more importantly his second important half-century in three innings in India. Handscomb was breezy but went quickly, Mitchell Marsh got a horrible ball that kept very low, and five were down by tea. But then it was another fifty partnership involving the elder Marsh that took Australia past India\u2019s total, and the match interestingly poised by the time he was out. Now we have Australia 48 up, with the chance to breeze past a lead of 100 with some Starc hitting tomorrow morning, or a chance to fall quickly to a rejuvenated Indian bowling attack for a lead of 60. Then it will be down to India to produce a good batting performance for the first time in the series, to try to set Australia some sort of chase. We\u2019ll be back here with you for that tomorrow, via the auspices of Russell Jackson. Until then, goodnight, afternoon, or morning from Geoff Lemon. 106th over: Australia 237-6 (Wade 25, Starc 14) Starc to face the last over. Ashwin bowling. And Starc enjoys pretending to be a top-order batsman, kicking balls away outside leg, leaving them outside off. For all his tricks, Ashwin can\u2019t find a way through, and the day ends with a solid defensive push of the bat, something which sums up India\u2019s inability to get past Australia today. Six wickets, yes, but the visiting team with the chance to add to a lead that while currently modest, could still be crucial on this pitch. 105th over: Australia 237-6 (Wade 25, Starc 14) Second-last over. India can\u2019t wait for this to be done. Umesh to bowl it. Wade gets a run with a glide, Starc goes to a similar area via the edge. Breezily 14 from 13 balls after everyone else today struggled to get close to a strike rate of 50. 104th over: Australia 235-6 (Wade 24, Starc 13) The specialist back on for the part-timer, Ashwin with the ball. Wade defends five balls, negotiates five safely, then the last one kicks up at him and he gloves it solidly away. Punches it, in fact. And it flies just wide of Rahane in at short mid-off. The batsmen pinch a run. 103rd over: Australia 234-6 (Wade 23, Starc 13) This is the damage Starc can do when he comes out late. Gets a short ball fomr Yadav, pulls it four four. Then drives a couple of runs over cover. Smack, smack. The lead out to 45. 102nd over: Australia 228-6 (Wade 23, Starc 7) Karun Nair on for a trundle, as the lead bowlers are cooked, and given India left out the extra bowler in Jayant Yadav, they\u2019re short of options. He bowls trash, some very wide stuff, but the boundary scored from him is trash too, Starc under-edging past the keeper. 101st over: Australia 221-6 (Wade 22, Starc 1) And a drop! Umesh nearly had two, as Starc nicks his third ball wide of the keeper, and Saha gets the flap of the glove to it as he dives across. He finally goes! Renshaw fell on 196 balls, Marsh goes from his 197th. He\u2019s surely exhausted, but so must Umesh Yadav be, and finally the fast bowler gets some reward. Standard straight ball, Marsh flicks across the line and chips it straight to midwicket for a comfortable, Pietersen-versus-Siddle catch. 100th over: Australia 220-5 (S Marsh 66, Wade 22) More ticking over, five singles from Jadeja. 99th over: Australia 215-5 (S Marsh 63, Wade 20) Wade jams Umesh Yadav away for a single, Marsh glides another, and there\u2019s a fifty partnership for this pair. Both subject to plenty of criticism, and this performance means a lot. The last wicket fell at 163. Both lefties find another single thanks to glides behind point. Ticking over a bit more now after some very slow and patient stuff. 98th over: Australia 211-5 (S Marsh 61, Wade 18) Jadeja back on for his 16th. Marsh plays a single off his pads without fuss. 60 on the board, there\u2019s the distant spectre of what would be a career-defining hundred here. Wade tries to sweep, top edges that ball away for another streaky four! Well, he\u2019s getting the results, I guess? Execution another story. 97th over: Australia 205-5 (S Marsh 60, Wade 13) Shaun Marsh soaking up the vast bulk of the strike here. Leaves a couple of Ishant balls, then is hit in the ribs as he shapes for a pull but can\u2019t time it. There\u2019s yet another lbw appeal, Ishant over the wicket, but that was angling too far across the left-hander and would have been easily missing off stump. 96th over: Australia 204-5 (S Marsh 60, Wade 13) Marsh edges Ashwin this over, not controlled, but has the presence of mind and the positivity to rush back for a second run even this late in the day, and dive into his ground. That\u2019s commitment. Flicks a single next ball. 95th over: Australia 201-5 (S Marsh 57, Wade 13) Shaun Marsh is a study in discipline today. He played well in Colombo, but I\u2019d gauge this innings as happening in more testing conditions. He leaves the ball with precision through three Ishant deliveries, then when a short ball surprises him he keeps it down for a single. 94th over: Australia 200-5 (S Marsh 56, Wade 13) Ashwin, getting loose as he tires, fires four byes down the leg side. The day grows late. And then comes the clincher. Another shocking review. Padded away by Wade. Ashwin thinks it caught some glove as it turned across the left-hander. The replay shows the ball hitting pad-flap, then leaping well over the gloves into Wade\u2019s shoulder. Nowhere near. India, both reviews gone, and still five wickets to get. The 200 comes up with a Marsh single. 93rd over: Australia 194-5 (S Marsh 55, Wade 12) Edging up to drinks, and just a couple more runs from Ishant\u2019s 21st over as Marsh plays a stylish cut shot away behind point. Once again looking in supreme control when he scores. And the patience - closing on 200 balls - has been exemplary. 92nd over: Australia 192-5 (S Marsh 53, Wade 12) Ashwin going back to the approach that got him Warner\u2019s wicket, with two lefties at the crease. Off spin, over the wicket, pitching outside leg and turning across. Marsh is using his feet with confidence now, though. Three singles from the over, several kicked away, Australia now in front. 91st over: Australia 189-5 (S Marsh 51, Wade 11) Yadav has been so impressive. Still running in, belting the ball down, good pace, discipline outside the off stump. He beats Wade thoroughly from the third ball of the over, but it doesn\u2019t take the edge. Wade jams a single thereafter, and Marsh levels the scores with a drive through cover. Australia still with five wickets in hand, but only the tail to come. This partnership is now worth 26 and growing in importance. 90th over: Australia 187-5 (S Marsh 50, Wade 10) A casual bat-wave as Marsh drives Ashwin square for one. He\u2019s been good. Plenty of luck with those close lbws, but he\u2019s held his composure, and his actual run-scoring has looked quite comfortable, even if his defence has been tested plenty on a difficult pitch. Very important innings given the currently low team score. Wade sweeps another single. 89th over: Australia 185-5 (S Marsh 49, Wade 9) Edged! Marsh is teasing the Indian bowling side now, as Australia grinds on towards India\u2019s first innings score. Thick edge into the ground, and Kohli at slip slaps it away falling to his left. Marsh gets off strike next ball with a flick, and Wade blocks out the rest of the over. 88th over: Australia 184-5 (S Marsh 48, Wade 9) It wasn\u2019t under dispute, but India are the worst reviewing side imaginable. We\u2019ve just passed the 80-over reset mark, there\u2019s yet another appeal against Marsh, and they review even though Marsh smashed that Ashwin delivery about six inches laterally off the inside edge into his pad. Marsh is settling now, gets a single via a steady on-drive, another through cover, while Wade uses the main weapon he has chosen for this trip and gets his run via a sweep. 87th over: Australia 181-5 (S Marsh 46, Wade 8) This pitch is becoming a minefield. A lead of 50 could be significant in the circumstances. This one from Umesh Yadav keeps very low, but somehow Marsh survives again as it misses his stumps. Only a isngle from the voer, cut from the last ball. 86th over: Australia 180-5 (S Marsh 45, Wade 8) Another lbw reprieve for Marsh! And another tough moment for Sharma, this time his own fault because he has overstepped. Marsh looked pretty well done frmo that ball, it moved in towards him from around the wicket and hit him in front. but the heel was over the line at the bowler\u2019s end. The batsmen scramble an extra run to make the tally two no-balls. And they collect three singles from the over, the lead is almost gone for India. 85th over: Australia 175-5 (S Marsh 44, Wade 6) Double seam attack. What even is this? They haven\u2019t taken the new ball yet either, in the 85th. Umesh Yadav, who was so good in the first Test. Draws a few leaves, then another good ball! Marsh given out lbw but reviews. Umesh around the wicket, angles a fast ball in, hits the front pad as Marsh tried to come across the line of the ball. Given by Umpire Illingworth, but the on-spec review strikes gold: the ball is found to be marginally striking the batsman outside the line of off, even though it was hitting half halfway up middle stump according to ball-tracking. I think those laws are garbage and that ball should be out. This \u2018outside the line\u2019 business is a hangover from the days of amateur and professionals. Who\u2019s with me? 84th over: Australia 175-5 (S Marsh 44, Wade 6) Edged this time, and four streaky runs for Wade. He\u2019s a left-hander, and the tall right-armer Ishant is working him over form around the wicket. That ball moved away from this now crumbling pitch. It\u2019s deteriorated even over the course of the day, from my vantage point. Edged just past Saha on the bounce. Then again! After leaving a couple, the next leaps at Wade, jabs into the outside edge, as he yanks his hand off the bat and the ball skews away on the bounce to slip. Gets him a single. Marsh serenely stuns the last ball into cover to take back the strike. 83rd over: Australia 169-5 (S Marsh 43, Wade 1) Four! Not without risk. Marsh comes down the wicket and lofts Jadeja, but it only just carries the long-on, who is two third of the way back to the rope. That\u2019s the first ball of the over, and Marsh goes defensive thereafter. 82nd over: Australia 165-5 (S Marsh 39, Wade 1) Ishant Sharma has been good today. Very frugal, accurate. 25 runs from 17 overs. Make that 18. A maiden to Wade, working him around that off stump. Some blocks and leaves. 81st over: Australia 165-5 (S Marsh 39, Wade 1) Jadeja to start up. A casual single for Senior Marsh to mid on. Matthew Wade comes on strike. Unloved, criticised, maligned. The urban ibis of Australian cricket, as per the cricket commentary I was listening to earlier. He does what the junior Marsh couldn\u2019t, and gets off the mark. A swept single. Get ready for some one-sentence Jadeja overs. Just by the way. This is some keraaaaazy stattology. Meg Lanning has just won a series decider against New Zealand with an unbeaten century, sure, that\u2019s good. But think about this. She\u2019s set the world record for most ODI hundreds in the women\u2019s game - given women\u2019s cricket has struggled to get huge numbers of games, that mark is 10. She\u2019s the first into double figures. But what makes it really remarkable is the speed. Lanning has made her 10 hundreds in 57 games, but she too the record from England\u2019s Charlotte Edwards, who made nine in 191 games. Think about it: 191 versus 57. Not far off a quarter as many matches. And an absurd rate on its own. Goooooood gracious. Wickets from the last ball of sessions. Aren\u2019t they great? I don\u2019t mean those hokey fake ones where it falls from the fourth ball of the over and then they call a break. I mean the genuine last ball, x.5 overs down, one last opportunity for the bowler. And then. \u201cGot him! The last ball of the day, can you believe that?\u201d Those Bill Lawry words are burned in the memory, courtesy of whoever cut together that opening segment that ran on the TV for so many years. Ishant Sharma. Well. Hello! Geoff here. Thanks Russell. Let\u2019s play cricketball. Well, that wasn\u2019t ideal for Australia But Ishant deserved that wicket, and replays reveal that Donald George Bradman himself probably wouldn\u2019t have got bat on it. That\u2019s it for me. Taking you through the rest of the day\u2019s play is Geoffrey Lemon, who will be with you shortly. WICKET! Mitch Marsh LBW Ishant Sharma 0 (Australia 163-5) 80th over: Australia 163-5 ( S Marsh 38) Disaster for Australia! Shaun Marsh sees off four deliveries in the final over before tea, but his younger brother can\u2019t keep out Ishant\u2019s final delivery, which keeps very low and traps him dead in front. His nightmare tour continue and Australia go to tea in a bit of bother. 79th over: Australia 162-4 ( S Marsh 37, M Marsh 0) Nervy times for Mitch Marsh, who is now nine deliveries into his innings but yet to move off his duck. Let\u2019s be honest: all of Australia is watching this. Poor bloke. Hopefully he gets some runs today for the sake of national harmony. 78th over: Australia 161-4 ( S Marsh 36, M Marsh 0) I believe this is only the second time the Marsh brothers have batted together in Tests, so get all of your jokes in while it\u2019s still possible. Are they the most unpopular Australian siblings since Shane and Bindi Paxton? Probably. 77th over: Australia 160-4 ( S Marsh 35, M Marsh 0) A wicket-maiden for Jadeja, and we\u2019ll have Marsh brothers batting at either end now. Gird up your loins, Australia. Ashwin juggles a beauty! And Jadeja gets Handscomb! That was a tough chance to the right of Ashwin at mid-wicket, but with a dive and a bit of juggling as he hits the deck, the big all-rounder hangs onto it. With that, yet another wicket has fallen with a major break not far away. 76th over: Australia 160-3 ( Marsh 35, Handscomb 16) The Australians might wish tea wasn\u2019t so close at the moment, because Ravis Ashwin is really tiring. He sends down a very fatigued long hop to start this over and Marsh latches onto it perfectly, whip-cracking his cut through the field to pick up four. Ashwin ends the over scratching his head and a little peeved. He\u2019s put in a fair old shift so far. 75th over: Australia 156-3 ( Marsh 31, Handscomb 16) Jadeja is racing through his overs, but Peter Handscomb is pretty clear with his plan, which is a much more attacking one than we saw in Pune. Again he skips down the track to get to the pitch of the ball and flicks the spinner over mid-wicket for a boundary. It\u2019s a bright start for the Victorian. 74th over: Australia 152-3 ( Marsh 31, Handscomb 12) Bang! Peter Handcomb gets down the track to Ashwin, so that he\u2019s right to the pitch of the ball, and deposits it over cow for a boundary. The horse has bolted, but Kohli and Ashwin immediately post a man back there. With that and three singles, it\u2019s a profitable over for the Australians. 73rd over: Australia 145-3 ( Marsh 30, Handscomb 6) Now Jadeja fires in a flatter one to Marsh, and that brings the short leg into play. Pujara, standing there, is soon diving to his left for a catch, but can\u2019t quite get there. Marsh responds to the pressure by nudging one towards mid on and sprinting through for a single. An underrated virtue of his, that. 72nd over: Australia 143-3 ( Marsh 29, Handscomb 5) Ashwin is coming around the wicket to Marsh, and close-ups of his deliveries reveal he\u2019s trying to bring it in off the seam to the left-hander. He\u2019s more conventional to Handscomb; over the wicket and turning it sharply towards off stump. 71st over: Australia 139-3 ( Marsh 28, Handscomb 2) Handscomb is away with a single through cover, a run Kohli attempts to cut off in 1970s style, throwing his boot at it. It doesn\u2019t work. Like Renshaw, something you can say of Handscomb is that he doesn\u2019t look remotely overawed in what is a quite testing environment for a rookie Test player. 70th over: Australia 136-3 ( Marsh 27, Handscomb 0) Ashwin gets the ball to rise up off the pitch like a cobra now, and Marsh does very well not to pat it into the hands of the man at silly point. The next curls past the outside edge, before Marsh settles himself with a rock solid forward defence. The crowd are really getting involved now, too. A tricky patch for the Australians. 69th over: Australia 136-3 ( Marsh 27, Handscomb 0) Jadeja has a good look at Handscomb here, and India mustn\u2019t have seen a lot of him because they continue to become excited by his unconventional and slightly ungainly defensive technique. In truth he\u2019s a very capable players of spin bowling. He\u2019s watchful in this over, and yet to get off the mark. 68th over: Australia 135-3 ( Marsh 26, Handscomb 0) All of a sudden Ravi Ashwin has a little more spring in his step, as he was having absolutely no luck piercing Renshaw\u2019s defence. Now he\u2019ll have a right-hander to bowl to as well, though Marsh takes strike in this over and offers a straight bat throughout. It\u2019s been tough work today, but India are still right in the contest here. If they can restrict Australia to 250, or a little less, and then put on 180 themselves, this pitch is going to be a nightmare in the fourth innings. 67th over: Australia 134-3 ( Marsh 25, Handscomb 0) Peter Handscomb is the new man at the crease for Australia, and he\u2019ll have about 40 minutes to contend with the Indian spinners before we head off for the tea break. Jadeja does the trick again! Two deliveries after he\u2019d skipped down the track and belted the first six of the innings, Renshaw ventures down again but misreads it, and with some smart work behind the stumps by Saha he\u2019s on his way. The Australian opener is absolutely livid with himself, and turfs his gloves as he reaches the boundary. He should also feel proud of himself his 60 from 193 deliveries was a helluva knock given the stakes. 66th over: Australia 128-2 (Renshaw 54, Marsh 24) At the risk of harping on the same point, this commentary is utterly maddening, but you need to have it on to get the audio from the ground. Is that a Faustian pact? \u201cYou can\u2019t stand still otherwise you go backwards,\u201d Hayden says now. I wish someone would roll his chair backwards a few metres. 65th over: Australia 123-2 (Renshaw 52, Marsh 22) As if inspired by the conversation here, the Australians now start pushing those aforementioned singles. There is one here by Marsh off Jadeja, who fields off his own bowling by sprinting to cover and sliding, but can\u2019t cut it off. It was at least a stylish dive. \u201cThe situation calls for a lot of game awareness,\u201d says Matthew Hayden, just throwing a whole heap of words out in front of TV viewers and asking them to put them in whichever order they wish. 64th over: Australia 121-2 (Renshaw 51, Marsh 21) Harking back to the Gervase Green email, I actually don\u2019t mind this approach at all. For one thing, it\u2019s a quite disorienting novelty compared to Australia\u2019s gung-ho batting displays of failed Indian campaigns. It\u2019s sort of working, isn\u2019t it? My glass is half full for now. 63rd over: Australia 120-2 (Renshaw 51, Marsh 20) Jadeja does indeed return now to replace Umesh, but the Australians handle him easily enough in his first over back. picking up a single apiece. \u201cHate to be a curmudgeon,\u201d writes Gervase Greene, \u201cbut I do reflect on all those maidens bowled to Smith (and therefore Renshaw) that might have had two runs an over, or even a single.\u201d \u201cBesides irritating the bowler and Kohli (and a single will generally have him approaching boiling point) we need to bear in mind on this pitch chasing 150+ tomorrow would be a graft. Doing so on Day five, if it ever came to that, is unimaginable. Not calling for the tonk, but a mindful nudge once in a while... Sorry to be glass-empty, but I have dark thoughts.\u201d 62nd over: Australia 118-2 (Renshaw 50, Marsh 19) Ashwin has a wide slip, a short leg, and a quite deep leg gully as he wheels away to Marsh, who can tell from that configuration what he\u2019s likely to receive. Should Ashwin not come around the wicket for a bit? He does turn one a mile in this over, but Marsh bats it down into the ground as it fizzes across towards the off stump. He\u2019s been a diligent, determined batsman so far today. 61st over: Australia 118-2 (Renshaw 50, Marsh 19) Further diminishing returns for Umesh Yadav, who keeps it tight in this over but still doesn\u2019t look like breaking through, and Marsh casually flicks one off his pads to pick up three. Time for some Ravindra Jadeja? Probably. With that, we\u2019ll have drinks. 60th over: Australia 115-2 (Renshaw 50, Marsh 16) Renshaw is now dancing down the track and belting Ashwin for a boundary to cow corner! Sensational stuff from the rookie opener. He\u2019s been going at a snail\u2019s pace today, as the situation demands, but with that blow and two through mid wicket, he brings up a determined half-century from 183 deliveries. For four hours he\u2019s resisted the best India has been able to throw at him. Take a bow, young man. This knock puts Australia in a very healthy position halfway through day two. 59th over: Australia 109-2 (Renshaw 44, Marsh 16) Umesh is not quite nailing this like he did earlier in the day bowling to Smith, so the session is just fading a little as Marsh establishes himself. Umesh strays onto Marsh\u2019s pads and he clips a couple of runs wide of mid-wicket. India have gone 17 overs without a wicket now. 58th over: Australia 107-2 (Renshaw 44, Marsh 14) OK, my eyes are even worse than I suspected. Scrap what I said about Marsh missing that edge (though it did, to be fair). It might in fact have brushed Marsh\u2019s thumb soon after it missed the edge, replays now reveal. That was the sound the Indians thought they\u2019d heard. Maiden for Ashwin. 57th over: Australia 107-2 (Renshaw 44, Marsh 14) Wriddhiman Saha is having a very taxing day at the office here, and it\u2019s hard not to feel sorry for him. The spinners are turning it prodigiously, which is hard enough to deal with, but with the ball keeping low when the quicks are operating, he\u2019s getting them on the bounce or around his ankles. Meanwhile, India have only one review remaining, and wisely they chose not to use it when Umesh thinks Marsh has got an outside edge to Saha. He missed it by the width of Merv Hughes\u2019 moustache. 56th over: Australia 106-2 (Renshaw 43, Marsh 14) Just a single to Renshaw from the Ashwin over, and when the Australian pair meet for their mid-pitch conference there is suddenly an air of command about their partnership. It now totals 24 runs from 15 overs. That is nothing to be sneezed at on a very tough day for batting. 55th over: Australia 105-2 (Renshaw 42, Marsh 14) Umesh Yadav is back to replace Ishant, and fresh limbs means he\u2019s getting his bouncers up that little bit higher, and Marsh almost nicks an attempted hook through to Saha. Umesh gets a little overzealous to that end, and when his third consecutive bumper just sits up in Marsh\u2019s hitting zone, the Western Australian swivels into a pull shot and expertly dispatches it to the ropes. Marsh might have played himself in here. 54th over: Australia 101-2 (Renshaw 42, Marsh 10) A boundary! Holy smokes, that came out of nowhere. Ashwin loops a very loose one down the leg side, and Marsh gets down on one knee to smother his sweep out to the fence at fine leg. There are four byes soon after to bring up Australia\u2019s hundred, though you could hardly blame keeper Saha in this instance. With a single Marsh makes it nine for the over, which is a run glut compared to what we\u2019ve seen in the rest of this second session. 53rd over: Australia 92-2 (Renshaw 42, Marsh 5) Ishant has two standard slips, a leg slip and a short leg for Marsh, and even though he knows what line of attack to expect, the Australian cops one in the armpit when he gets his bat out the way of a bouncer. Ouch. Much like his father, he refuses to acknowledge the blow in any way. Tough. \u201cI want to go into the brain of Matthew Hayden,\u201d says Brett Lee, speaking on behalf of no other person on earth. 52nd over: Australia 91-2 (Renshaw 42, Marsh 4) Marsh continues to pad up to Ashwin, or else gets back and across with a confident backward defence. From the final delivery of the over he pushes a single to wide mid-off. Ashwin has looked the goods all day, but somehow the Australians continue to blunt his impact. 51st over: Australia 90-2 (Renshaw 42, Marsh 3) Ishant continues to Renshaw and though he\u2019s still got the short leg in place, he poses an Umesh-like threat more than anything. Sooner or later one is going to keep so low that one of these left-handers can\u2019t jam down his bat in time. Kohli brings in a leg gully, but Renshaw plays out a maiden without too many troubles. He\u2019s 42 from 163 deliveries now, the 20-year-old. He\u2019s singlehandedly distorting all those nonsense stats about the attention spans of millennials. 50th over: Australia 90-2 (Renshaw 42, Marsh 3) \u201cThey\u2019re whittling it away,\u201d is Matthew Hayden\u2019s take on Australia\u2019s last few overs, in which they haven\u2019t scored a run. Eventually Renshaw gets one off Ashwin, but it\u2019s hard yakka. Shaun Marsh is in all sorts of bother against Ashwin, and has to do three things to stop one delivery; he shapes to pad up, changes his mind and blocks it, then has to kick it away from the stumps when it nearly rolls back to bowl him. 49th over: Australia 89-2 (Renshaw 41, Marsh 3) Poor Ishant could do with a little more assistance out of this pitch as he fires down short ones to Shaun Marsh. It\u2019s like trying to get a hacky sack to bounce at the moment. He does eventually get some bounce, but it\u2019s backbreaking work. With Marsh not entirely comfortable, a short leg comes into play, but Marsh stands firm. Third maiden on the bounce. India are tightening the screws. 48th over: Australia 89-2 (Renshaw 41, Marsh 3) Ashwin keeps at Renshaw, and as the Queenslander passes 150 deliveries faced, it\u2019s probably time to start admitting he\u2019s not doing too badly against one of the world\u2019s best spinners. It\u2019s not pretty, and he\u2019s barely scoring off him, but he\u2019s also still out there. Maiden. 47th over: Australia 89-2 (Renshaw 41, Marsh 3) Save for his first ball of the day, which was angled down the leg side and dispatched for a boundary, Ishant Sharma has been an outstanding contributor for his side today. He\u2019s sliding them away from Shaun Marsh to start the second session, and looking to build pressure from which Ashwin might profit. His penultimate delivery draws a throaty LBW shout against Marsh, but it was pitching a foot outside leg stump, even if it would have hit the stumps. 46th over: Australia 89-2 (Renshaw 41, Marsh 3) We\u2019re back after lunch with Ravi Ashwin twirling it down to Matt Renshaw, who is encircled with close-in fieldsmen but gets up and running again with a single. Not for the first time in the series, Shaun Marsh then become involved in a near run-out, though it wasn\u2019t entirely clear whose fault it was. He gets through for the single in the end. To say he needs some runs here is something of an understatement. Usman Khawaja waits in the wings. 45th over: Australia 87-2 (Renshaw 40, Marsh 2) And that is lunch on day two. Ishant gave Matt Renshaw six of his best, but the Queenslander was up to the task, and heads off for a breather with 40 runs to his name from 144 deliveries. His efforts typify the entire morning of cricket. It\u2019s been tough, attritional cricket, and neither side has given an inch. The wickets of David Warner and Steve Smith were blows for Australia, but they\u2019ve also toughed out some superb spells of bowling from Ravi Ashwin, Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav. Virat Kohli got in Steve Smith\u2019s face earlier in the day, and is revving the crowd up until the very last ball of the session, which Australia finish at 87-2. Test cricket eh? 44th over: Australia 86-2 (Renshaw 39, Marsh 2) Ashwin returns and has a go at Marsh now, but the only thing doing is an outside edge which flies well wide of silly point. We\u2019ll have one more over before lunch, which looks like it\u2019ll be bowled by Ishant Sharma. Maybe he\u2019ll get a wicket to go with his manic gurning from earlier in the morning. 43rd over: Australia 83-2 (Renshaw 37, Marsh 1) Somewhat surprisingly, the tiring Umesh Yadav is granted another over, though I guess Kohli will be hoping he can exploit the Australian No4\u2019s penchant for fishing outside off stump to the quicks. Here Marsh is determined to leave, and only plays when they\u2019re straight. It works a treat. If Umesh is done, he\u2019s bowled a gem of a spell without taking a wicket. 42nd over: Australia 83-2 (Renshaw 37, Marsh 1) Marsh gets off the mark with a single, which infuriates Ravi Shastri. So it\u2019s not all bad for Australia. Super over from Jadeja. He\u2019s done exactly what India needed before lunch. And there it is! Jadeja slides one in a bit quicker to Smith and when the inside edge balloons up from his front pad towards the vacant leg slip region, Saha sprints around and dives to snaffle the chance. The Aussie skipper doesn\u2019t even wait for the verdict. He knows he\u2019s cooked. Worse: he\u2019s been dismissed 12 minutes before lunch, so Shaun Marsh will have to come out and face a brief spell of hostility, on a hiding to nothing. 41st over: Australia 81-1 (Renshaw 36, Smith 8) An understatement: a late wicket before lunch will really throw the cat amongst the pigeons, and based on what we\u2019ve seen so far in this series, it wouldn\u2019t be an unlikely sight. Umesh continues, but I\u2019d be tempted to bring back Ashwin if I was Kohli; he and Jadeja are a constant threat and really hurry through their overs. 40th over: Australia 80-1 (Renshaw 35, Smith 8) We\u2019ll have just under 20 minutes more cricket in what has been a truly magnificent morning of testing cricket for both sides, and Steve Smith continues to do very well at picking off singles. Jadeja has two LBW shouts against Renshaw when the tall lefty sweeps, but only the latter is entirely credible. Renshaw is doing that so that contact with pad or bat occurs outside the line of off stump. So far it\u2019s working. 39th over: Australia 78-1 (Renshaw 34, Smith 7) Yadav continues to the sounds of horns and hollering, but the ball is talking most in this over. Renshaw can only shake his head and shrug his shoulders after the paceman shapes two consecutive deliveries away from his outside edge. The first deviated off the surface, the second was reverse swing. A third merely straightens. Renshaw has a huge grin on his face, but only because he\u2019s surviving a quite superb spell of pace bowling and one expertly tailored to the conditions. 38th over: Australia 78-1 (Renshaw 34, Smith 7) Ravindra Jadeja appears now to relieve Ashwin, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, Australia have seen off a very threatening spell by India\u2019s No1 bowler, on the other they have often collapsed when faced with the wares of his replacement. He\u2019s coming over the wicket to Renshaw, with a short leg and a slip. Renshaw has a good look and finishes the over by sweeping a single. It wasn\u2019t Haydenesque, but it did the job. 37th over: Australia 76-1 (Renshaw 33, Smith 6) Umesh has been trading in low bounce today, but out of nowhere he sends one whistling past the shoulder of Matt Renshaw\u2019s bat when the ball takes a savage deviation out of a crack, and an edge follows a ball later. Should that have been caught? Oh dear. Perhaps Kohli could have caught it if he\u2019d stayed low at first slip, but he rises to a standing position and the ball arrives on the half-volley before flying away for four. \u201cThat\u2019s what we call the dentist catch\u201d, says Brett Lee, throwing out a phrase I never once hear in my years playing cricket. 36th over: Australia 72-1 (Renshaw 29, Smith 6) A five-man conference takes place before Ashwin takes his cap off to bowl this over, but the net result is nothing more exciting than a Matt Renshaw single and some stern defensive efforts by Smith. More importantly, the Ishant Sharma GIFs are now rolling in. 35th over: Australia 71-1 (Renshaw 28, Smith 6) Smith continues to trust his eye here, and steps back and across in front of his stumps to defend Yadav\u2019s low shooters. Were it any other batsman in Australia you\u2019d argue it\u2019s foolhardy, but you can hardly argue with the weight of numbers in the last few years. Yadav has his heart in his mouth every delivery of this maiden, but Smith sees it off. 34th over: Australia 71-1 (Renshaw 28, Smith 6) To be fair to him, Renshaw is really rising to the Ashwin challenge now, and though he rarely looks like scoring, he\u2019s forced the masterful spinner around the wicket for a new line of attack. That is a minor psychological victory in a fairly one-sided contest. 33rd over: Australia 70-1 (Renshaw 28, Smith 5) Renshaw v Ashwin and Smith vs Yadav are the main contests right now, if you take Kohli out of the equation (he is fighting all of Australia). Smith mixes things up a bit by getting off strike, which Renshaw is probably glad for, and he gets a low edge through gully to pick up four. Yadav isn\u2019t quite as threatening against the left-hander, though Renshaw gets even luckier with his second boundary of the over: a genuinely unintentional edge between first slip and third. It took Renshaw 70 minutes to make his first five runs today, and he\u2019s just burgled eight more in a few minutes. 32nd over: Australia 61-1 (Renshaw 20, Smith 4) Another tight over from Ashwin, who has Renshaw wrapped around his little finger, but can\u2019t quite flick him off. Kohli is doing everything bar engage in a rap battle in his ongoing conversation with Steve Smith. 31st over: Australia 61-1 (Renshaw 20, Smith 4) Yadav gets another go at Smith after the break and he\u2019s causing a few problems when the ball keeps low and takes deviations out of the cracks. The big threat he poses is LBW, I think, especially with Smith shuffling across his stumps. Australia\u2019s run rate has crawled to two per over, and this is some truly absorbing, series-shaping cricket under way on day two. I\u2019ve no idea how, but Smith survives the over without being pinned in front. I think Umesh Yadav might get at least two or three more overs based on that one. Kohli and Smith are still going at it. 30th over: Australia 61-1 (Renshaw 20, Smith 4) \u201cMatthew Hayden has quite a large p....ool,\u201d says Michael Clarke, though nobody was asking. Ashwin also had a big appeal for a close-in catch when Smith was on strike, but it was all pad according to Nigel Llong. Drinks are out on the ground now and they\u2019ve certainly earned them so far. Oof, that was very lucky for Smith as it was only shaving leg stump, so it goes back to the umpire\u2019s call. Nigel Llong gave it not out, and that is how it stays. The bowler is very keen on this. Nervous times for Smith, who was attempting to pull it away from his front knee roll and missed. Or did he get an underside edge? We shall soon see. 29th over: Australia 59-1 (Renshaw 19, Smith 4) \u201cIt\u2019s 27 degrees in Bangalore...hardly the cauldron everyone is making it out to be,\u201d says reader Kabir Sethi. \u201cProbably the tension of the game more than anything else.\u201d Indeed. Just on that, Ishant did a superb job attacking and containing from his end, but his bolt is now shot so Umesh Yadav appears for a trundle. I reckon he\u2019ll get a couple of overs, and if he doesn\u2019t nip one of these two out, Kohli will turn to Jadeja. Ishant is staying involved by sledging the bejeezus out of Renshaw, which is nice. Yadav is keeping it worryingly low. 28th over: Australia 59-1 (Renshaw 19, Smith 4) It\u2019s not just Ishant getting stuck into Steve Smith, Virat Kohli is having a dip at it as well and really trying to get under the Australian captain\u2019s skin. Lots of spice in this one, though Smith is laughing it off for now. Ashwin continues to probe away at Renshaw\u2019s giant front pad, and the giant front pad continues to win. For now. 27th over: Australia 59-1 (Renshaw 19, Smith 4) Matthew Hayden is talking about \u201cthe cauldron of Indian cricket\u201d and \u201cthe furnace of the wicket\u201d. Someone get him in front of an air conditioner, please. Anyway, that\u2019s not his most disturbing image. He says this of Matthew Renshaw, who is currently doing well merely to survive: \u201cHe\u2019s not only standing up, he\u2019s dominating!\u201d Calm down Haydos, he\u2019s made four runs in the last 50 minutes. Out in the middle, Smith and Ishant are really going at each other, pulling faces between balls and really jawing off in an over-long exchange. Ishant is doing this best work with a very exaggerated impersonation of Smith\u2019s facial expressions. I think the heat is getting to him as well. 26th over: Australia 58-1 (Renshaw 18, Smith 4) Ooft. Renshaw is dicing with danger here, as Ashwin spins them across him from the rough. The Queenslander is taking the Warner route and leaving it with his stumps exposed, which as we know, didn\u2019t exactly come up trumps. At least in this over he gets a couple of singles to leg. Using the bat is probably the way to go. 25th over: Australia 54-1 (Renshaw 16, Smith 2) Tense times call for tough characters, and Steve Smith\u2019s narrow-eyed focus is abundantly clear as he faces up to Ishant. The paceman is bowling with the spirit of the Demon Spofforth right now, but Smith eventually gets off strike with a single to point. Renshaw handles the rest, but he\u2019s copping a real barrage. 24th over: Australia 53-1 (Renshaw 16, Smith 1) Ashwin continues his cold war with Matt Renshaw, but I sense there could some weaponry unleashed soon enough. I\u2019ve no idea how, but Renshaw pokes, prods and pads up, and negotiates his way through the onslaught. It\u2019s not going to get any easier. Ashwin might bowl all innings the way he\u2019s going now. 23rd over: Australia 53-1 (Renshaw 16, Smith 1) Every delivery is subject to a raucous wall of sound from the locals right now, and a minor verbal skirmish followed that Renshaw-Ashwin stand-off late in the last over. On top of that, Ishant has worked his way into a very handy spell. This is why they call it Test cricket. Ignoring that, Brett Lee is spending the time between deliveries counting how many fidgets Steve Smith does. I, meanwhile, am spending the same time counting down the minutes until Brett Lee is gone from the commentary box. Back in the middle, Ishant has a big LBW shout against Smith, but after a conference with keeper Saha, Kohli decides against a review. Smart. It was probably sailing over the top of the stumps. This is simply gripping stuff in Bangalore. There can\u2019t be many more engaging contests in sport than a tense Australia-India clash. 22nd over: Australia 53-1 (Renshaw 16, Smith 1) Steve Smith walks out to the middle now and gets off the mark with a single thanks to a minor imbroglio in which Renshaw won\u2019t get out the way, so it trickles down to long leg, but India are all over the tourists here and the crowd is really getting involved too. Ashwin can scent blood in the water, and the Australians have a fierce battle on their hands. Warner is removed by a gem! Holy smokes, that is an absolute peach from Ashwin, whose first ball of the over to Warner pitches outside leg, catches the Aussie opener in two minds and then fizzes across him to take the off stump. What was Warner doing? He shuffled across and exposed all three stumps. It turned a long, long way, and I\u2019ve got to say, it was hardly surprising. The Aussie left-handers are in for a real battle today. 21st over: Australia 52-0 (Warner 33, Renshaw 16) Ishant\u2019s off-side protection against Warner has moved around to deep cover now, and the opener duly clubs one out there for a single. Reader Sankaran Krishna is enraged by all this, though that might be a little harsh on Ishant. He\u2019s bowling with a decent head of steam so far. \u201cLyon gets 8-50 on the first day and Virat begins the second day with Ishant???\u201d complains Sankaran. \u201cThis is beyond dumb. Starting with Ashwin and Jadeja would send a different message altogether.\u201d 20th over: Australia 50-0 (Warner 32, Renshaw 16) Renshaw is looking far less comfortable against Ashwin than Warner before, and he gets very lucky with an inside-edge into his pad, which balloons over the head of the man at short leg while not quite carrying to mid wicket. The rookie opener is putting his bat away so far, which doesn\u2019t inspire much confidence. A maiden for Ashwin, and Renshaw has plenty to contemplate. 19th over: Australia 50-0 (Warner 32, Renshaw 16) One thing I missed at the end of that Ashwin over prior: he finished it by hurling the ball back to the keeper\u2019s end, narrowly missing Warner\u2019s scone. Ishant isn\u2019t quite so puffed up, or effective, and after a single to Renshaw, Warner clatters him through the cover region with an angled bat to pick up another boundary. Ishant responds with a bouncer, which rears up awkwardly and almost clips Warner\u2019s bat as he flinches out the way. He\u2019s coming to life now. 18th over: Australia 45-0 (Warner 28, Renshaw 15) Unsurprisingly given the need for an early wicket, Ravichandran Ashwin will pair with Ishant in the early stages. He\u2019s got a gully, a leg slip and short leg for Warner, and pursues a leg-side line in the hope the left-hander will do something rash. To start with Warner just pads up, but when Ashwin straightens just a fraction, a huge off-break goes fizzing past the outside edge of his forward defence. That was a jaffa. Matt Renshaw probably gulps at the other end. It\u2019s a maiden, and a probing one. 17th over: Australia 45-0 (Warner 28, Renshaw 15) Ishant Sharma starts us off on day two and arrives with an absolute shocker, which is angled well down leg and glanced for a gimme boundary by David Warner. \u201cThat\u2019s an ominous beginning,\u201d says Sunny Gavaskar, who cannot hide his displeasure. Warner is batting well out of his crease to start with, a good half-metre or so, and cracks a single out to the man at deep point. Renshaw calmly sees off the rest. A bit on Australia\u2019s preparation for this series: the Dubai training camp was more about getting the pace off the ball, and practicing on wickets with less bounce, than spin per se. That according to batting coach Graeme Hick, who is talking at the sidelines now. He says this will be an \u201cexciting day\u201d watching the likes of Steve Smith strut his stuff. If Australia win this series 4-0, and Tony Abbott makes a late charge at the coalition leadership, we really can\u2019t rule out a knighthood for the once-maligned English batsman. Anyway, we\u2019re a few minutes from play now. Let\u2019s do this. Good stuff from Michael Clarke, though somebody needs to have a word with him about shooting his videos in landscape mode. Sunny Gavaskar is out in the middle now looking at the pitch, whose hexagonal cracks make it look like the wall tiles in a Moroccan hotel bathroom. It\u2019s like a third-day WACA wicket, reckons Mark Waugh, who ponders whether it\u2019s actually more a mental hurdle for batsmen than a technical one. Ryan Harris also reckons there is a bit too much emphasis on the surface. We\u2019ll see. It was taking some sharp turn yesterday. I\u2019ll say this: if this game lasts longer than the fourth morning I\u2019ll be very surprised. \u201cThis is a series defining day\u201d, says Ravi Shastri at the sidelines just now, and with his wraparound shades \u2013 straight out of a Greg Chappell Cricket Centre catalogue from 1995 \u2013 he is surely correct. He wonders aloud whether the pressure is getting to India now, which is a pretty big call six days into a four-Test series. Premable Hello all and welcome back to another day in bizarro world, where a reality TV show host is the leader of the free world and Nathan Lyon is a record-shattering star of world cricket. Today I\u2019ll be taking you through the second day of the Bangalore Test between India and Australia, which will only get stranger if Matthew Renshaw decides in the next ten minutes to retire from cricket and become a basket-weaver, and Harold Holt walks out to open the batting with David Warner. What can we actually expect today? Well, If Australia can post anything close to 300, I\u2019d hesitantly say they\u2019ve got this Test and the Border-Gavaskar trophy in the bag. But that will be hard. For one thing, this pitch is already taking a lot of spin. The dual threats of Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja loom. And Kohli can\u2019t keep falling cheaply, surely? All that and more soon. Russell will be here shortly. In the meantime, catch up on day one\u2019s drama, brought to you courtesy of Nathan Lyon:",

O\u2019Connor said that, while the Labor party had long been the guardian of the independent national workplace relations tribunal, the party had no option but to oppose the decision. \u201cWe are the only political party that has been the guardians of this institution for 113 years so it is a rare thing to do,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cQuite frankly, last Thursday, when Bill and I looked at the decision, we were \u2013 to say the least \u2013 surprised and disappointed that there was a significant net loss to workers without compensation whatsoever and we felt we had no option but to stand on the side of workers. \u201cI can assure you, we make no apology for it. It was the right decision to make.\u201d O\u2019Connor said the rates cut would effect minimum awards in certain industries across the country and he called on the One Nation Senate crossbenchers and Derryn Hinch and Nick Xenophon to reconsider their decision. One Nation\u2019s leader, Pauline Hanson, has already indicated her support for the penalty rates cut, while Xenophon and Hinch have supported, in principle, the Fair Work Commission as an independent tribunal even though, in 2013, Xenophon has tried to use a private member\u2019s bill to cut penalty rates. Xenophon told Guardian Australia he believed there was merit in the former workplace minister Eric Abetz\u2019s suggestion that penalty rate cuts could be \u201cgrandfathered\u201d so no existing worker would be worse off. \u201cThere is merit in what Eric is saying, I think we need to look at it carefully,\u201d Xenophon said. \u201cI don\u2019t want see existing workers worse off. \u201cWe do have to support the independent umpire but the umpire needs to take into account this is a time of low wage growth and we can\u2019t reduce take-home pay.\u201d Hanson said she supported the penalty rate cuts because it gave small business a chance to grow and said low-income workers would still have a wage. Within hours of Hanson\u2019s comments, Unions NSW had sent out a message across social media platforms that said, \u201cHanson supports greatest wage cut since the Depression\u201d. Meetings are planned this week between unions, church groups and community groups to map out a campaign against the penalty rates cut, which will run up to and past the next election. Targeting the Coalition and Hanson\u2019s base in regional and rural communities, the Unions NSW secretary, Mark Morey, accused Hanson of siding with the government to cut the wages of working people in the regions. \u201cMrs Hanson is a false prophet who purports to represent \u2018the battlers\u2019 while at the same time siding with Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s government to cut the pay of working people with the hardest hit those living in regional and rural communities,\u201d Morey said in the social media messages. \u201cThe trade union movement intends to shine a light on One Nation and its duplicitous agenda of cutting the pay packets of working Australians.\u201d Morey told Guardian Australia the union movement would coordinate campaigning through trade and labour councils, community groups and religious organisations that oppose the penalty rate cut. \u201cOur plan is to work cooperatively with a broad range of unions to run community-based campaign to inform people of the effect of the cuts to penalty rates campaign and to shift votes at the next election,\u201d Morey said. \u201cWe are going to work with faith groups, [parents and citizens] groups, church groups, community groups, anywhere where unions members have connections to take our message to them. \u201cThe idea is that the union movement act as one around this and it will not be a short-term campaign, it will go past the next election.\u201d Unions NSW will also launch a new website on Monday called Save Penalty Rates to drive the campaign and engage with affiliate organisations while taking part in the national movement. This will add to other union websites and campaigns including the Megaphone petition and Save our Weekend. On Sunday the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the Fair Work Commission would consider the transition process and take into account the effects of the decision. The Fair Work Commission will take submissions on the transition process to implement the penalty rate cut until 24 March. \u201cThe Fair Work Commission has a process, which they have now embarked on, which deals with how they will be better off or otherwise or worse off and how that can be mitigated going forward,\u201d Morrison said. After a parliamentary sitting week that was dominated by penalty rates, Coalition backbenchers report frustration over the tactics of the senior leadership on the issue. George Christensen told Fairfax Media the penalty rates cut could cost him his seat. Politicians will spend a fortnight gauging the response in their electorates to the decision before another sitting fortnight starting March 20. One Liberal MP spoke of the exasperation at the government\u2019s tactics. \u201cWe are in an impossible position,\u201d the MP told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe can\u2019t talk about the substance of the issue, we can\u2019t talk about the detail of the decision and the reality is the economic benefit of it is as about as small as it gets but the political pain is as big as it gets. \u201cAll we can do is talk about is Bill.

      "bodyText": "In the inner Sydney suburb of Redfern, residents, developers and Indigenous activists are pondering a drastic change to the skyline. The suburb\u2019s historic Block \u2013 the first urban Indigenous land rights claim in Australia \u2013 has been earmarked for a dramatic new extension to an already contentious development, which some residents say will hasten the gentrification of a suburb with a strong Indigenous history. Under a proposal lodged late last year by the Aboriginal Housing Company (AHC), the site will accommodate a student accommodation complex of 16 storeys and more than 500 dwellings, in what the City of Sydney called a \u201csignificant departure\u201d from previously approved plans. When the Pemulwuy Project was first approved in 2012, it was capped at six storeys, yet it drew an intense and prolonged protest. In 2014, activists occupied the site with a tent embassy, demanding more social and affordable housing for the suburb\u2019s long-term residents. The standoff was ended with a $5m pledge from the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, to fund the construction of 62 affordable homes. But the AHC chairwoman, Alisa Tutuila, said government funding has stalled, and with no proposed increase in the number of low-rent homes, opponents of the $70m development say the new plans will accelerate change in Redfern. \u201cThey\u2019re acting as a private developer not a community organisation,\u201d said tent embassy organiser and Wiradjuri elder Jenny Munro. \u201cIf they can build 500 housing places for students, they could build a lot more houses for our people. This is being driven by profit, and that\u2019s the problem. The community misses out badly.\u201d The University of Sydney students\u2019 reprentative council\u2019s student housing officer, Jenna Schroder, said it was \u201cdisappointing the project has not seen an increase in the number of affordable dwellings for Indigenous residents\u201d. \u201cThe Pemulwuy Project offers nothing special or affordable for students with its rent prices, preying on the international student market like many residential buildings in the area,\u201d she said. But Tutuila said the proposed increase in student housing was the only feasible way to deliver low-rent homes. \u201cThere has been no specific government funding to cover the entire precinct of affordable housing. The $5m grant is actually still in negotiations with the minister\u2019s office, and in saying that, doesn\u2019t cover the whole cost,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we had to re-engineer this model, so it will allow us to yield off the extra height to build the affordable housing and the commercial precinct at once. The revenue from this model will allow us to build more affordable housing and future developments in the Sydney area.\u201d A letter from the AHC to the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment put the blame on \u201cinsufficient funds [from] the various levels of government and philanthropists\u201d, saying the AHC was \u201crequired\u201d to fund the project with other means. The AHC has owned the land around the Block since 1973 and Tutuila said she is \u201cvery confident we have overwhelming community support \u2013 both from Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities\u201d. But Munro said she had been \u201cexcluded\u201d from the process. She confirmed she would be making a submission to the council opposing the development and urged other members of the Aboriginal community to do the same. The NSW planning department said the AHC had been issued environment assessment requirements for the project, which would require it to justify the proposed scale. If the project receives more than 25 objections after it is put on public display, or if the council objects, the department will refer it to the independent Planning Assessment Commission. The suburb also faces huge changes through the Central-to-Eveleigh revitalisation program, a high-density development project that includes a new metro railway station in nearby Waterloo and homes for an estimated 29,000 to 56,000 new residents. The Waterloo public housing estate will alone accommodate 5,000 new private homes and 14,000 new residents, which the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore, labelled the densest residential development in Sydney. In December, UrbanGrowth NSW, the government body overseeing Central-to-Eveleigh, made a submission in support of the Pemulwuy expansion, saying it supported \u201cintegrating new high-density mixed-use buildings with existing neighbourhoods and places\u201d. Geoffrey Turnbull, from the Redfern-Waterloo community organisation RedWatch, was optimistic about the impact the Pemulwuy development would have on local residents. \u201cWe won\u2019t know until we see the final diagrams and where those shadow diagrams go, but the afternoon sun will have as good as no impact on other developments,\u201d he said. \u201cIn an ideal world it would be nice to have delivered on the project as it was put together, however they haven\u2019t been able to get funding and this seems at this point the only way. It\u2019s not the ideal outcome but it\u2019s far better than just nothing happening.\u201d Tutuila told the Guardian that further information on the project\u2019s timeline would be available at a public meeting on Thursday, but Munro has vowed to fight the development. \u201cWe have a grave situation in relation to housing in our community. Our population in Redfern has gone from 40,000 when I came here as a young woman in the 70s to less than 300 now. It\u2019s all deliberately designed to push the black community out, that\u2019s what gentrification is about,\u201d she said. \u201cOur community will be moved out because of the pressure applied by both the public housing provider and the one Aboriginal housing provider the community historically relied on. \u201cIf they think 62 houses will cater to the Aboriginal community in the inner city, they are living on Mars.\u201d",

When it was suggested a lot of her supporters would be impacted by the decision, Hanson said \u201cI\u2019m hoping to give small businesses a chance for growth\u201d. She said low-income workers would be still be getting a wage. Hanson said, as a former business owner, she had sympathy for small businesses that had to compete with larger companies like McDonald\u2019s, which could negotiate enterprise bargaining agreements with unions for lower wages. \u201cHow can you expect someone to pay $34 an hour in wages in a takeaway shop, food retail, yet McDonald\u2019s are paying $26,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cWhere is the union jumping up and down for the battlers?\u201d Her argument was in stark contrast to the Coalition, which has steadfastly refused to argue either way on the penalty rate decision, saying only it was the decision of an independent umpire. Shorten, who before the decision said he would support the FWC\u2019s decision, attacked the Coalition all week for not blocking the penalty rate cut. Labor and the Greens have urged the Coalition to block the rate cut in parliament. \u201cThis government is doing nothing about addressing this whole issue and Labor are a bunch of hypocrites,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cI think if we looked at it, we might be able to increase employment by helping small business.\u201d Hanson warned the government could not rely on her support for the company tax cut package announced in the 2016 budget. Hanson said she would prefer to get rid of state payroll taxes, which she said were a tax on employment. She said the treasurer, Scott Morrison, had told her the states would not \u201ccome to the table\u201d. As the Coalition struggles with a one-seat majority, Hanson had some surprising advice for Christensen, who had repeatedly threatened he would leave the Coalition unless his areas of concern were addressed. \u201cI advise him, stay where you are, because if he jumps ship, it will destabilise the government and I don\u2019t believe the people want that and they would not want it from me,\u201d she said. \u201cStabilise the government, because we need that. Then he can decide his future. If he actually then says, \u2018No, I\u2019ve had enough, I can\u2019t stay with the National party, they are not representing my electorate, what I want\u2019, of course. If he wants to come across to One Nation, I\u2019m not going to say no but I am not encouraging him.\u201d Of the WA election next weekend, Hanson said he expected to win seats in her own right in the upper house. She said the WA Liberal-One Nation preference swap had come about because the Liberal party had changed its position on preferences with her party \u2013 not the other way around. She rejected criticism from some of her own candidates for dealing with the Liberal party. \u201cI have no problem with saying that because it is our best chance of getting One Nation candidates selected to the floor of parliament. Of course, who is not going to do it?\u201d Labor\u2019s Brendan O\u2019Connor said it was extraordinary that such an undemocratic leader could be a hero for Hanson. \u201cI find it quite offensive and contemptible that Senator Hanson would applaud and laud such a leader given the complicity of Putin in the deaths of 38 Australians,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite extraordinary that someone so undemocratic, someone who it would appear has been involved in the deaths of so many Australians would be a hero of Senator Hanson.\u201d",
