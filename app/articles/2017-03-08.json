The Aemo report predicts New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia will be impacted from the summer of 2018-19 and warns that the tightening of the domestic gas market will have flow-on effects to the electricity sector unless there is an increase in gas supplies and development. It also warns that rising gas and electricity prices could threaten the financial viability of commercial and industrial businesses. The report found that even new supply \u2013 with rising gas production costs \u2013 was unlikely to provide much relief and could still lead to business closures. \u201cIf we do nothing, we\u2019re going to see shortfalls in gas, we\u2019re going to see shortfalls in electricity,\u201d Aemo\u2019s chief operating officer, Mike Cleary, told the ABC. Malcolm Turnbull said he was concerned about potential gas shortages and will be calling east coast gas companies together for a meeting next week. \u201cI\u2019ll be urgently calling the chief executives of the east coast gas companies together, to explain how they plan on addressing this threat to their customers,\u201d Turnbull told a business forum on Thursday. In a statement, Cleary said: \u201cAt a time when LNG export is dominating demand and supply of gas in eastern states, strategic national planning of gas development has never been more critical for maintaining domestic energy supply adequacy across both gas and electricity sectors.\u201d He said a national policy was required because the gas and electricity markets could no longer be viewed in isolation. \u201cThe overall convergence of energy markets in eastern and south-eastern Australia demands a single energy view from a national perspective,\u201d Cleary said. \u201cIt requires holistic planning across the entire supply chain to enable investment decisions to be made in the long-term interests of consumers.\u201d Australia is one of the top 20 gas producing countries in the world but the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, blamed lack of domestic supply on unconventional gas moratoriums in states including NSW and Victoria and a conventional gas moratorium in Victoria. \u201cWe have a real challenge in Australia\u2019s gas market and that\u2019s coming from a confluence of factors, particularly the state-based moratoriums on gas exploration particularly on unconventional gas but also in the state of Victoria on conventional gas,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is drying up production and exploration.

The report said domestic gas price signals could give Queensland LNG producers incentive to supply gas, previously contracted for export LNG, to the domestic market. Frydenberg again ruled out a domestic gas reservation, as happens in many other gas-producing countries such as the US, Israel and Indonesia as well as in the state of Western Australia, on the grounds that it would stop companies developing new projects. \u201cThe issue in Australia has always been that it would be a deterrent to further investment if you were going to restrict the gas merely for domestic supply as opposed [to] for international export,\u201d he said. But he praised the Queensland government\u2019s move to reserve a specific area for development for domestic supply only. \u201cI have recently seen what has happened in Queensland where that state government has offered a tenement for companies to invest in if that case is supplied domestically,\u201d Frydenberg told ABC\u2019s AM. \u201cI think that is quite a creative way forward because it doesn\u2019t introduce the possibility of sovereign risk because it doesn\u2019t effect existing investments but it does encourage further investments to supply the domestic market.\u201d Frydenberg said gas was increasingly important, not just in households and manufacturing but because it supplied 20% of Australia\u2019s electricity. \u201cIncreasingly gas is in demand because it is setting the price of power as more renewables come into the system so we really do need urgently to get more gas and more gas suppliers because we need more competition between these companies into the market,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations in Western Australia are dismayed that neither major party has committed to introducing a custody notification service ahead of Saturday\u2019s election, despite a recommendation from the state coroner. The service, which has operated in New South Wales since 2000, would make it mandatory for police to contact the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS) whenever they took an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person into custody. The scheme is widely regarded to have been successful in NSW, which last year saw its first Indigenous death in police custody in 16 years. In her report into the death Yamatji woman Ms Dhu, who died in the South Hedland lockup in 2014, WA state coroner Ros Fogliani said a similar scheme should be introduced. The introduction of the service is a key issue for the ALS and the the First Nations Death in Custody Watch Committee, both of whom acted for and supported the Dhu family through the four-week inquest. It underpins an approach to the justice system that both organisations said should become less punitive and more therapeutic, if both crime and incarceration rates are to reduce. Carolyn Lewis, co-chair of the death in custody watch committee and cousin of Ms Dhu\u2019s grandmother, Carol Roe, said she was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in the response from both Labor and Liberal parties. \u201cThis has been an ongoing battle for us for many years, and for many people before us,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen is this government, or any government, going to step up?\u201d WA has the highest imprisonment rate in the country, jailing Aboriginal people at 16 times the rate of non-Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people make up 38% of WA\u2019s prison population, despite being just 3.4% of the total population. That incarceration rate is a key election issue for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voters, alongside concerns about native title, remote community closure, the Aboriginal Heritage Act, and jobs. The Liberal party has committed to exploring all recommendations made by the coroner, but has previously argued that its non-mandatory 24/7 helpline for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander detainees negated the need for another service. The opposition justice spokesman, Paul Papalia, said Labor would consider introducing a custody notification service but had made no firm commitments. Labor has however committed to ending the practice of jailing people for unpaid fines, as Ms Dhu was. \u201cWe will do what\u2019s necessary to ensure that fine defaulters don\u2019t sit on their hands in prison over the weekend at a cost of $770 a day and are instead out there in the community paying it off,\u201d Papalia told Guardian Australia. He suggested that policies intended to reduce the number of lower-level offenders in custody could negate the need for a custody notification service, because fewer people would be in custody. \u201cWhy would any cases with respect to the Dhu inquest happen if you weren\u2019t locking up people solely for fine default?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s pretty clear reducing the possibility of some people dying in custody if you don\u2019t lock them up.\u201d Peter Collins, director of legal advocacy at the ALS in WA, said requiring police to call the ALS and funding the ALS to provide a 24/7 custody notification service would help reduce incarceration rates by improving access to justice, as well as serving as a welfare check. \u201cIf they are going to give real access to people\u2019s rights under the Criminal Investigation Act, the only way to do that is under the custody notification scheme,\u201d he said. In the far north of the state, the focus of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voters has been on the local candidate race, where for the first time both Labor and the Liberal party are fielding Indigenous candidates. Labor MP Josie Farrer, a Lunga Kitja woman from the East Kimberley, is fighting to hold the seat she won with a 5.1% margin in 2013 against a challenge from Liberal candidate Wayne Greatorex, a Nyikina and Jabirr-Jabirr man from the West Kimberley. Greatorex is the first Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person to stand for a lower house seat for the Liberal Party in WA and his nomination has split the vote, according to Kimberley Land Council(KLC) chief executive Nolan Hunter. In the Kimberley, that could make a significant difference: 40% of the population is Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and 70% of the land is held under some form of native title. Issues that have limited shelf-life in the south, like the threat to close remote Aboriginal communities that morphed into the regional service reform project, still bite up here. Hunter, a Bardi Jawi man, said there was still a lot of uncertainty about the regional reform process, which is supported by the Liberal, Labor, and National parties. Another concern is the Liberal government\u2019s approach to forming joint management agreements with native title holders, which Hunter said appeared designed to push traditional owners out of the picture. \u201cThe premier, Colin Barnett, made a statement about how he did not wish to see environmental management in the hands of Indigenous corporations or Aboriginal people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t say to people who have spent 14 years or more getting their native title recognition\u2026 \u2018now that you\u2019ve got your native title back, hand it over to us and we\u2019ll be in total control of it\u2019. Hunter said native title should not be seen as a barrier to development and said initiatives like the Indigenous rangers program, which is currently funded at a national level and through the state-based Royalties for Regions scheme, showed how it could work. Labor has committed $20m over five years to expanding the ranger program, and Nationals leader Brendon Grylls said his party would continue to support it through Royalties for Regions scheme, as well as committing $75m to an Aboriginal tourism fund. Hunter said he also judged governments by the level of engagement with Indigenous people, saying the KLC had \u201cvery little engagement with (Liberal Indigenous affairs minister Peter) Collier over the years\u201d and a \u201cfantastic\u201d amount of engagement from National party regional development minister Terry Redman, who was put in charge of the regional services review project by Barnett. \u201cGovernments can always be criticised for what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult job. I think the best governments govern for the people and listen to the people and when that doesn\u2019t occur then people vote with their feet and you get the impending results.\u201d",

The move was part of plans for a voluntary industry-led code announced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the G20 body that monitors and makes recommendations about the financial system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/06/big-australian-banks-invest-7bn-more-in-fossil-fuels-than-renewables-says-report\">Big Australian banks invest $7bn more in fossil fuels than renewables, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/17/apra-says-companies-must-factor-climate-risks-into-business-outlook\">Summerhayes warned</a> climate change posed a material risk to the entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. Apra is the regulator that oversees the $6tn industry made up of banks, building societies, superannuation, insurance companies and other financial institutions. </p> <p>Summerhayes said Apra already sent out common scenarios for institutions to test. These scenarios have an economic factor, including an asset price shock and, in the case of the insurance industry, a potential liabilities scenario as well.</p> <p>\u201cIt is possible in the future that climate could be such a risk that we would want to test,\u201d Summerhayes said. \u201cThat is not in our current plans but it is possible as other emerging risks are, that we would scenario test.\u201d</p> <p>He acknowledged the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) had been very active on climate change. The bank\u2019s governor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/29/carney-warns-of-risks-from-climate-change-tragedy-of-the-horizon\">Mark Carney, has warned</a> of financial crises and falling living standards unless corporations faced up to the risks. \u201cApra is not first prudential regulator to make statements about climate,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Emma Herd, the chief executive of Investor Group on Climate Change, told the committee the political debate in recent years had stopped companies speaking publicly about their strategic response to climate change.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIn terms of company reporting, the challenge for companies is that \u2026 any statement that is made around climate change as a financial risk is then interpreted through the prism of the political debate,\u201d Herd said. \u201cSo companies have to be incredibly cautious about statements that they are making and constantly apply that political lens and I think that is creating a level of conservatism that is inhibiting how companies talk about their strategic response to climate change.</p> <p>\u201cCompanies are often much more prepared to talk fully and frankly to investors about their view than they are to talk publicly and into the public debate because it is just seen through the prism of the debate of the last 10 years.\u201d</p> <p>Herd revealed unpublished research from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors from 1 March this year, in which an analysis of 167 ASX 200 companies found there were large gaps in corporate reporting. It found:</p> <ul> <li>Only 69 companies (41%) publicly state that they acknowledge climate science or identify and assess climate risk;<br /></li> <li>Only 106 companies (63%) report on their greenhouse gas emissions;<br /></li> <li>Only 36 companies (22%) publicly report on climate change-related targets.</li> </ul> <p>Herd said reports were very short on detail with many companies simply disclosing their emissions. Very few disclosed a strategy for dealing with the climate-related issues that might affect the businesses, or report on mitigating these risks.</p> <p>Summerhayes said his climate warning last month came about due to three factors: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/10/turnbull-signals-australia-wont-follow-trumps-lead-on-paris-climate-agreement\">Australia\u2019s Paris commitments</a>, the Bloomberg taskforce and <a href=\"http://cpd.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Legal-Opinion-on-Climate-Change-and-Directors-Duties.pdf\">the legal opinion by Noel Hutley SC</a> for the Centre for Policy Development and the Future Business Council on company directors\u2019 duties and climate change.</p> <p>Last month he said: \u201cThe opinion found that company directors who fail to properly consider and disclose foreseeable climate-related risks to their business could be held personally liable for breaching their statutory duty of due care and diligence under the Corporations Act.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Summerhayes said climate was an active discussion in many of the institutions supervised by Apra. </p> <p>\u201cMarkers that have been put down in the last year are significant and markets are already adjusting to those markers and the extent to which the draft report to FSB is adopted or not, we are of the view that a transition is under way to a lower-carbon world and that has implications on the risks that Apra-regulated entities need to oversee.</p> <p>\u201cHence we expect them to be having a conversation about it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/04/coalitions-laser-like-focus-only-sees-what-it-wants-to-see\">Coalition's 'laser-like focus' only sees what it wants to see | Lenore Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kate O\u2019Rourke of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said the regulatory framework was flexible enough to accommodate scenario testing and companies could choose to dramatically change their information disclosures on climate risks. </p> <p>Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/13/energy-policy-no-room-for-partisan-politics-18-groups-tell-government\">a coalition of business, energy, climate and welfare groups issued a joint statement warning</a> that a decade of partisan politics and finger-pointing had destroyed investor confidence in Australia\u2019s energy sector.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/Carbon_Risk_Disclosure/Terms_of_Reference\">The Senate inquiry</a>, initiated by Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson and restarted after the federal election, is looking into carbon risk and disclosure in corporate Australia.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s financial institutions could be required to test climate-risk scenarios as international regulators continue to warn of the economic dangers posed by climate change. Geoff Summerhayes, executive board member of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), told a Senate committee that climate scenario testing could be added to the other common scenarios Apra requires financial institutions to face to ensure their systems are robust. It\u2019s been more than a year since the COP21 Paris climate change conference, when the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg was appointed to head a taskforce to provide investors, insurers, banks and consumers with more information. The move was part of plans for a voluntary industry-led code announced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the G20 body that monitors and makes recommendations about the financial system. Last month Summerhayes warned climate change posed a material risk to the entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. Apra is the regulator that oversees the $6tn industry made up of banks, building societies, superannuation, insurance companies and other financial institutions. Summerhayes said Apra already sent out common scenarios for institutions to test. These scenarios have an economic factor, including an asset price shock and, in the case of the insurance industry, a potential liabilities scenario as well. \u201cIt is possible in the future that climate could be such a risk that we would want to test,\u201d Summerhayes said. \u201cThat is not in our current plans but it is possible as other emerging risks are, that we would scenario test.\u201d He acknowledged the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) had been very active on climate change. The bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, has warned of financial crises and falling living standards unless corporations faced up to the risks. \u201cApra is not first prudential regulator to make statements about climate,\u201d he said. Emma Herd, the chief executive of Investor Group on Climate Change, told the committee the political debate in recent years had stopped companies speaking publicly about their strategic response to climate change. \u201cIn terms of company reporting, the challenge for companies is that \u2026 any statement that is made around climate change as a financial risk is then interpreted through the prism of the political debate,\u201d Herd said. \u201cSo companies have to be incredibly cautious about statements that they are making and constantly apply that political lens and I think that is creating a level of conservatism that is inhibiting how companies talk about their strategic response to climate change. \u201cCompanies are often much more prepared to talk fully and frankly to investors about their view than they are to talk publicly and into the public debate because it is just seen through the prism of the debate of the last 10 years.\u201d Herd revealed unpublished research from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors from 1 March this year, in which an analysis of 167 ASX 200 companies found there were large gaps in corporate reporting. It found: Only 69 companies (41%) publicly state that they acknowledge climate science or identify and assess climate risk; Only 106 companies (63%) report on their greenhouse gas emissions; Only 36 companies (22%) publicly report on climate change-related targets. Herd said reports were very short on detail with many companies simply disclosing their emissions. Very few disclosed a strategy for dealing with the climate-related issues that might affect the businesses, or report on mitigating these risks. Summerhayes said his climate warning last month came about due to three factors: Australia\u2019s Paris commitments, the Bloomberg taskforce and the legal opinion by Noel Hutley SC for the Centre for Policy Development and the Future Business Council on company directors\u2019 duties and climate change. Last month he said: \u201cThe opinion found that company directors who fail to properly consider and disclose foreseeable climate-related risks to their business could be held personally liable for breaching their statutory duty of due care and diligence under the Corporations Act.\u201d Summerhayes said climate was an active discussion in many of the institutions supervised by Apra. \u201cMarkers that have been put down in the last year are significant and markets are already adjusting to those markers and the extent to which the draft report to FSB is adopted or not, we are of the view that a transition is under way to a lower-carbon world and that has implications on the risks that Apra-regulated entities need to oversee. \u201cHence we expect them to be having a conversation about it.\u201d Kate O\u2019Rourke of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said the regulatory framework was flexible enough to accommodate scenario testing and companies could choose to dramatically change their information disclosures on climate risks. Last month a coalition of business, energy, climate and welfare groups issued a joint statement warning that a decade of partisan politics and finger-pointing had destroyed investor confidence in Australia\u2019s energy sector. The Senate inquiry, initiated by Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson and restarted after the federal election, is looking into carbon risk and disclosure in corporate Australia.",

You are one of the 22% with lived experience; while I don\u2019t envy the admissions committee its job, I do think that any process that automatically deems you unfit to be a doctor needs re-examining. I understand these variables are hard to measure but by dismissing them I fear that we emphasise to students that ultimately what matters is a high score albeit on several tests instead of one. The mismatch between what we say we value (a whole person) and what we actually value (a high grade) leads to frantic pressure to perform well and view life through the narrow prism of one\u2019s own needs. You remind me of an intern who stood at the bedside of a dishevelled and despondent mother with young children who was complaining bitterly to a group of stumped doctors what \u201cmy kind of poor\u201d really meant. Her weekly income seemed small but exactly how small? Only one other person knew and without hesitation, he announced, \u201cIf she gets a loaf of bread, a bottle of milk, pays her rent on time, fills up half the petrol in her car and replaces a child\u2019s school shoes, she has no money left.\u201d The patient\u2019s gratified expression said it all. Astonished, I whispered in an aside to my intern, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d \u201cBeen there,\u201d he answered grimly. I will always remember the perspective he brought to our team \u2013 it was discomfiting, as special as it was rare. Medicine needs these rare sorts to interpret the stories of our patients. \u201cDid your school know you wanted to study medicine?\u201d I ask, almost searching for another culprit, though I know well that your school\u2019s limitations mirror those of your community. \u201cI told nobody.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI thought they would put me down for dreaming big.\u201d My heart constricts at your simple but flawed thinking and I fight to prevent it from making a permanent home in your head. So I tell you that anyone who knows you couldn\u2019t possibly regard you with anything less than admiration. I pledge to introduce you to people who will nurture your dream. And then, I stop fumbling with my pen, and say what I have been wanting to say all along except I didn\u2019t want to measure out false hope. But really, how can a young woman like you ever have too much hope? So I tell you I would be proud someday to call you my doctor. Your mother has sat quietly the whole time. Now, she brushes away a tear. Your father grasps my hands tightly. You say nothing. Your smile lights up the whole room.",

      "bodyText": "Three of Australia\u2019s big four banks have opposed parliamentary recommendations that senior executives should be automatically named for breaches affecting customers. The chief executive of Westpac, Brian Hartzer, was the final of the big four bank bosses to appear before the house standing committee on economics reviewing past behaviour. Under the proposal, banks would be required to publicly disclose breaches of licence conditions soon after reporting them to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), including naming managers responsible for sections involved and any disciplinary consequences. In the past week, Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank refused to support the recommendation, while the chief executive of ANZ, Shayne Elliot, supported the principle of naming executives but said the five-day reporting period was problematic. On Wednesday Hartzer said Westpac supported increasing transparency and accountability but it was not practical to report in such a way. \u201cThe point I am making is that when you get to the issue of consequences, in some cases where something is a massive significant issue, you might take action at that time,\u201d Hartzer said. \u201cIn other cases, these things range, it is not black and white.\u201d Hartzer said Westpac had \u201cno issue\u201d with identifying senior executives, but had concerns with elements of the recommendation including the timeframe and listing consequences. He said it was important for the banks to be able to explain disciplinary actions, because it was \u201cmore complicated than X happened with Y consequence\u201d. In opposing the proposal Commonwealth Bank\u2019s chief executive, Ian Narev, told the committee on Tuesday that public reporting of breaches occurred expeditiously, often before disciplinary consequences had been determined. Narev suggested that disclosing disciplinary consequences in annual reporting to shareholders would be more appropriate. On Tuesday Elliot told the committee that public disclosure could be implemented but questioned the proposal to link it to breach reporting to Asic. He warned that \u201coverly punitive sanctions\u201d could result in a \u201cculture of fear\u201d, preventing people speaking up about their own or others\u2019 mistakes. In Wednesday afternoon\u2019s hearing, the Australian Bankers Association chief executive, Steve Munchenberg, updated the committee on development of a \u201cbad apples\u201d register. The register would allow prospective employers to check if a bank worker had been fired or faced other disciplinary consequences at their previous employer. Munchenberg said the register was \u201ceasy to say but difficult to do\u201d because of concerns about privacy and natural justice. He also warned it could be open to abuse if a manager threatened to put a staff member on the register, preventing them securing work elsewhere. Munchenberg said the industry was still developing the register but it might require legislation to establish. Committee member, Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite told Guardian Australia the register should be run by Asic or the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority should provide the register so it is \u201cnot subject to industry manipulation\u201d. Earlier in the hearing, the chair of the committee, Liberal MP for Banks David Coleman, raised the prospect of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) having a standing function to examine competition across the industry as a whole. Coleman said the ACCC currently only focused on certain breaches of competition law but did not extend to the broad perspective of competition in sector. Hartzer replied that the sector already \u201cfeels very competitive\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t fundamentally object [to ACCC reviews] but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary.\u201d Hartzer noted the financial system inquiry had recommended giving Asic a mandate to review competition and argued six-monthly ACCC competition reviews would amount to duplication. Munchenberg said the banking sector didn\u2019t have \u201cperfect competition\u201d. But he opposed a dedicated unit in the ACCC, deriding it as a \u201cmake-work program\u201d. The parliamentary committee was established by the Coalition in response to pressure from Labor, the Greens and Nick Xenophon for a royal commission. Asked about a royal commission, Hartzer said it would be expensive and would not bring about immediate action and the banking industry was already highly regulated \u2013 echoing the government\u2019s objections to such a commission. On Tuesday Elliott said the large number of more targeted reviews currently under way were better at achieving \u201creal change\u201d. Labor and Liberal MPs traded barbs about the necessity of a royal commission. Labor\u2019s Madeleine King arguing that threats of a royal commission had prompted other reviews. Liberal MP Julia Banks said a royal commission was like a semi-trailer attempting to do a U-turn, compared with the \u201csnappy sports car\u201d of more targeted reviews. Last month a former Westpac banker was sentenced to three years in prison after signing up elderly customers to $4m in loans they could not repay. The bank also decided to refund foreign transaction fees paid by hundreds of thousands of credit card customers after it decided it has disclosed too little information about the charges. Westpac, NAB and ANZ are also facing legal action over allegations of rate rigging. Hartzer said the bank was disputing some of allegations in the past six months but it was on the path to closing the \u201ctrust gap\u201d.",

The above passage, for instance, could be applied with equal legitimacy to the feminist response to Julia Gillard\u2019s prime ministership in Australia a few years ago. But they could also easily be read as a series of straw-feminist arguments and therefore dismissed just as easily by the very proponents of the philosophy she seeks to critique.</p> <p> This is particularly striking when Crispin\u2019s presumably deep engagement with the broad spectrum of feminist theory is represented by little more than an acknowledgements list at the end of the book. After all, the objections Crispin makes to contemporary feminism are not new. </p> <p>Consider the opening passages to bell hooks\u2019 Feminist Theory: From Margin to Centre, which feel just as relevant as they did when it was written over 30 years ago: \u201cThe ideology of \u2018competitive, atomistic liberal individualism\u2019 has permeated feminist thought to such an extent that it undermines the potential radicalism of feminist struggle.\u201d Or the criticisms of contemporary feminists by the writer and activist Arundhati Roy, who argues that viewing gender \u201cshorn of social, political and economic context makes it an issue of identity, a battle of props and costumes\u201d.</p> <p> The lack of theory, history and context<strong> </strong>represented in this work feels like a missed opportunity and makes it difficult to translate Crispin\u2019s critique into a practical pathway forward. There\u2019s no more than a passing mention of intersectionality in the book, for example \u2013 arguably the most prominent theory circulating in the contemporary feminist movement and a concept that has a complicated relationship with the often-atomising identity politics that pervades so much of the contemporary feminist activity that Crispin finds infuriating. </p> <p>Similarly, if her position is fundamentally anti-capitalist \u2013 and in her comments elsewhere she has stated that <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/3/6/14761392/feminism-capitalism-socialism-patriarchy-jessa-crispin\">she sees patriarchy and capitalism as inextricable</a> \u2013 it\u2019s odd that such an otherwise strident work avoids being more explicit in this respect. She talks about capitalism, yes, but only in general terms. A deeper analysis of the specifics would open up a broad range of practical strategies \u2013 trade unionism, for example \u2013 as well as a method of analysis through which to identify a common enemy and thus provide a more concrete path forward.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"257e0c419f35b0f382355e3220f9e957b2eeab49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/257e0c419f35b0f382355e3220f9e957b2eeab49/0_0_520_804/323.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image of Why I Am Not a Feminist by Jessa Crispin\" width=\"323\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> As Shulamith Firestone argued: \u201cBefore we can act to change a situation ... we must know how it has arisen and evolved, and through what institutions it now operates.\u201d These origin stories are critical: the recognition that oppression exists must be accompanied by an understanding of how it occurs, what forces allow it to continue to function. How can we develop a comprehensive strategy for change otherwise? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/03/jessa-crispin-the-woman-at-war-with-lifestyle-feminism\">Jessa Crispin: the woman at war with lifestyle feminism</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Firestone\u2019s objective in The Dialectic of Sex was an attempt to follow the methodology of Marx and Engels in order to \u201cenlarge historical materialism\u201d \u2013 that is, to widen the scope of a class analysis using the \u201cscientific approach to history\u201d that characterised the duo\u2019s works on capitalism. Similarly, Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s The Second Sex \u2013 to which Firestone was in part responding \u2013 was a meticulous attempt to build an argument about the origins, manifestations and consequences of sexism using Hegel and existentialism as a framework. </p> <p> Too often patriarchy, and thus sexism, exists in mainstream feminism as a free-floating concept, fundamentally attributed to personal prejudice rather than an analysis of material conditions. Unfortunately, without this theoretical grounding, such concepts function in a similar way in Crispin\u2019s work \u2013 loose enough to be adopted by the reader in whichever way she sees fit. </p> <p> Insofar as Crispin\u2019s work is a call for a deeper, more critical engagement with the rich tapestry of feminist ideas that exists outside the mainstream \u2013 for the development of alternative possibilities and new ideas for how to build collective resistance to forces of oppression \u2013 it is a welcome one. It is disappointing, though, that her book itself falls short of attempting to offer those very things which are most needed.</p>",

Consider the opening passages to bell hooks\u2019 Feminist Theory: From Margin to Centre, which feel just as relevant as they did when it was written over 30 years ago: \u201cThe ideology of \u2018competitive, atomistic liberal individualism\u2019 has permeated feminist thought to such an extent that it undermines the potential radicalism of feminist struggle.\u201d Or the criticisms of contemporary feminists by the writer and activist Arundhati Roy, who argues that viewing gender \u201cshorn of social, political and economic context makes it an issue of identity, a battle of props and costumes\u201d. The lack of theory, history and context represented in this work feels like a missed opportunity and makes it difficult to translate Crispin\u2019s critique into a practical pathway forward. There\u2019s no more than a passing mention of intersectionality in the book, for example \u2013 arguably the most prominent theory circulating in the contemporary feminist movement and a concept that has a complicated relationship with the often-atomising identity politics that pervades so much of the contemporary feminist activity that Crispin finds infuriating. Similarly, if her position is fundamentally anti-capitalist \u2013 and in her comments elsewhere she has stated that she sees patriarchy and capitalism as inextricable \u2013 it\u2019s odd that such an otherwise strident work avoids being more explicit in this respect. She talks about capitalism, yes, but only in general terms. A deeper analysis of the specifics would open up a broad range of practical strategies \u2013 trade unionism, for example \u2013 as well as a method of analysis through which to identify a common enemy and thus provide a more concrete path forward. As Shulamith Firestone argued: \u201cBefore we can act to change a situation ... we must know how it has arisen and evolved, and through what institutions it now operates.\u201d These origin stories are critical: the recognition that oppression exists must be accompanied by an understanding of how it occurs, what forces allow it to continue to function. How can we develop a comprehensive strategy for change otherwise? Firestone\u2019s objective in The Dialectic of Sex was an attempt to follow the methodology of Marx and Engels in order to \u201cenlarge historical materialism\u201d \u2013 that is, to widen the scope of a class analysis using the \u201cscientific approach to history\u201d that characterised the duo\u2019s works on capitalism. Similarly, Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s The Second Sex \u2013 to which Firestone was in part responding \u2013 was a meticulous attempt to build an argument about the origins, manifestations and consequences of sexism using Hegel and existentialism as a framework. Too often patriarchy, and thus sexism, exists in mainstream feminism as a free-floating concept, fundamentally attributed to personal prejudice rather than an analysis of material conditions. Unfortunately, without this theoretical grounding, such concepts function in a similar way in Crispin\u2019s work \u2013 loose enough to be adopted by the reader in whichever way she sees fit. Insofar as Crispin\u2019s work is a call for a deeper, more critical engagement with the rich tapestry of feminist ideas that exists outside the mainstream \u2013 for the development of alternative possibilities and new ideas for how to build collective resistance to forces of oppression \u2013 it is a welcome one. It is disappointing, though, that her book itself falls short of attempting to offer those very things which are most needed.",

This sense of remoteness is keenly felt by people in the community. I don\u2019t know if the government realises its role in actually governing.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a sense of remoteness is borne out when parliament does things like its decision to allow the government to release the personal information of veterans to the media \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/02/exclusive-ministers-office-sent-journalist-internal-briefings-about-centrelink-client\">Centrelink-style</a> \u2013 \u201cshould it wish to correct public statements\u201d.

Yet not one member of the lower house \u2013 independent or in any party \u2013 resisted the passage of the original vote.</p> <p>You can\u2019t help but conclude it\u2019s because veterans and defence personnel occupy an nearly invisible political space in Australia. Traditionally, the right takes its votes for granted and the left doesn\u2019t challenge it when it does. Those struggling to understand the electoral survival of Jacqui Lambie in the upper house  should consider her genuine rarity among politicians, as someone <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2016/s4629832.htm\">willing to dedicate consistent activism</a>, rather than platitudes, towards Australia\u2019s returned veteran community. </p> <p> Retired colonel and veteran activist Ray Martin shares the frustration felt by so many, especially in the shadow of such slow progress on policy responses to urgent situations, like suicide: \u201cThe conservatives think we vote for them, so they take us for granted,\u201d says Martin. \u201cLabor thinks we vote conservative, so to a degree they think it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/mar/08/international-womens-day-2017-protests-activism-strike-live\">International Women's Day 2017: protests, activism and a strike \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Martin insists that the service performed by the defence force demonstrates a diversity and complexity that goes unregarded. \u201cA good defence force reflects its society \u2013 and our defence force is very good, with a lot of respect overseas,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey\u2019re good soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen, but they\u2019re also compassionate, and known for their empathy.\u201d</p> <p> But their empathy doesn\u2019t appear returned to them by society at large. Australians, whether right or left, rarely challenge the notion of defence service beyond embracing or rejecting the simplistic wrapping of flags, slouch hats, symbols, pins and platitudes, jingoistic TV drama and the affected, uncomfortable use of words like \u201cmateship\u201d, \u201cAussie\u201d, \u201cdigger\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-32313043\">\u201cAnzac\u201d</a>. </p> <p>What\u2019s underneath the props and costumes, of course, are human beings \u2013 some who come home, prosper and thrive, and some with bad fortune, who return to suffering and pain.

      "bodyText": "How many Australian soldiers would have to be murdered to spark national talk of a crisis? Five? Ten? If a single serving member of defence personnel was killed by a terrorist, do we really think it would escape the front page news? We\u2019d know, because we\u2019re a caring nation, aren\u2019t we? We plant flowers by the roadsides of accidents, we mark national tragedies with legacy mountains of gifts, and more flowers, and cards. But since the beginning of the year, 14 veterans of service in Australian armed forces are reported to have taken their own lives, a number most Australians may be shocked to learn. This figure\u2019s in addition to the 78 reported to have taken their lives just last year \u2013 \u201creported\u201d, because the morbid numbers are tallied by veterans groups from sources in person and from Facebook, counting lives lost among old colleagues, family members and friends. Suicide has killed more than four times as many soldiers than those lost in combat since 1999, yet it barely registers in the national consciousness of a country that had a royal commission to investigate four deaths resulting from the poor installation of pink batts. There\u2019s presently a Senate inquiry into veteran suicide, and it\u2019s just had its submission dates expanded. It\u2019s received over 300 submissions, and they are harrowing reading. Numerous shared experiences inform the individual circumstances of the deaths. Post-service unemployment. Financial problems. Relationship breakdown. Injuries and medical issues. Extreme frustration with the institutional rigidity of Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs processes, present and historical. They\u2019re problems, of course, that do not perish with the dead; they are the daily afflictions of the living. Loretta Somerville is one: ex-navy, and the survivor of a suicide attempt. In 1991, she was serving when she was sexually assaulted off-base by a group that included two of her colleagues. Trauma, injuries and a historical process that obliged her to continue serving in the same community as the men who raped her drove her out of the navy \u2013 her career \u2013 with lifelong consequences. In 2015, she overdosed. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about ending life,\u201d she said to me, \u201cas it is about ending that pain.\u201d Stuart McCarthy is another who lives in the consequences of his service. His career as an army engineer saw his active service in Bougainville, Eritrea and Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iraq and two tours of Afghanistan in 2011. It also saw him given an experimental drug, tefanoquine, an early cousin of the infamous anti-malarial drug mefloquine. McCarthy\u2019s return to civilian life came with family and financial stresses amid the effects of what\u2019s since been diagnosed as a \u201cchemically acquired brain injury\u201d. I encountered him for the first time on Facebook, offering to sell his service medals for help affording specialist treatment. He\u2019s since withdrawn the medals from sale, but he can\u2019t retreat from his frustration with a post-service \u201cveterans affairs\u201d system that speaks to good intentions but delivers a confusing array of obstacles and inadequate resourcing. \u201cI\u2019m an army officer of 28 years,\u201d he tells me of his problems negotiating the complexities of DVA support, \u201cif this can happen to me, I can see how it happens to much more junior people. And it happens again and again and again. We\u2019re not getting the help that we need.\u201d David Jamieson, the National President of the Defence Force Welfare Association, understands the concerns; his is one of 24 veterans organisations who met in Canberra last week to collaborate more closely. \u201cThe government aren\u2019t trying to do the wrong thing,\u201d he tells me \u201cbut they\u2019re not flipping listening. We\u2019re spending a lot of money, but the rate of suicide is not reducing.\u201d Jamieson\u2019s issue is one you hear across a range of Australian communities, from Indigenous groups to family violence advocates. \u201cThe government are spending $150m for veterans\u2019 mental health issues,\u201d he tells me \u2013 but the money stays at the top, \u201cwhile on the ground, we have small groups of people with no resources or backing trying to help each other, and often they\u2019re getting better results.\u201d Jamieson\u2019s next remark sounds very familiar: \u201cThey listen far too much to their political advisers and departmental advisers \u2013 these people are professional and well-meaning but they\u2019re too removed from the coalface ... This sense of remoteness is keenly felt by people in the community. I don\u2019t know if the government realises its role in actually governing.\u201d It\u2019s a sense of remoteness is borne out when parliament does things like its decision to allow the government to release the personal information of veterans to the media \u2013 Centrelink-style \u2013 \u201cshould it wish to correct public statements\u201d. It\u2019s been vehemently opposed by veterans activists, and Labor, at least, is now publicly rethinking its position before it heads to the Senate. Yet not one member of the lower house \u2013 independent or in any party \u2013 resisted the passage of the original vote. You can\u2019t help but conclude it\u2019s because veterans and defence personnel occupy an nearly invisible political space in Australia. Traditionally, the right takes its votes for granted and the left doesn\u2019t challenge it when it does. Those struggling to understand the electoral survival of Jacqui Lambie in the upper house should consider her genuine rarity among politicians, as someone willing to dedicate consistent activism, rather than platitudes, towards Australia\u2019s returned veteran community. Retired colonel and veteran activist Ray Martin shares the frustration felt by so many, especially in the shadow of such slow progress on policy responses to urgent situations, like suicide: \u201cThe conservatives think we vote for them, so they take us for granted,\u201d says Martin. \u201cLabor thinks we vote conservative, so to a degree they think it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d But Martin insists that the service performed by the defence force demonstrates a diversity and complexity that goes unregarded. \u201cA good defence force reflects its society \u2013 and our defence force is very good, with a lot of respect overseas,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey\u2019re good soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen, but they\u2019re also compassionate, and known for their empathy.\u201d But their empathy doesn\u2019t appear returned to them by society at large. Australians, whether right or left, rarely challenge the notion of defence service beyond embracing or rejecting the simplistic wrapping of flags, slouch hats, symbols, pins and platitudes, jingoistic TV drama and the affected, uncomfortable use of words like \u201cmateship\u201d, \u201cAussie\u201d, \u201cdigger\u201d, \u201cAnzac\u201d. What\u2019s underneath the props and costumes, of course, are human beings \u2013 some who come home, prosper and thrive, and some with bad fortune, who return to suffering and pain. And, like any citizens who suffer, they deserve more from the structures supposed to support them. So much more. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.",

It was important that Nazanin understood well how life is in Manus to tell the story in artistic language. \u201cWhen the play was ready Nazanin invited me to inaugurate the play,\u201d Boochani told The Guardian. \u201cThat was an interesting moment... I went to beach and made a short speech to the actors and audience and read a part of my own writing about Manus prison and the concept of being a prisoner.\u201d Sahamizadeh said few people in Iran were aware of Australia\u2019s offshore detention regime, despite Iranians being the largest cohort of detainees on both of Australia\u2019s offshore islands. \u201cThere is no information about these camps at all in Iran and no news about the events and disasters that have been happened there,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe just a few people have heard a brief headline of news. \u201cI thought only Reza Barati had been killed by camp authorities but others have also died in the camps.\u201d She said she had been stunned to learn of the detention centre on Manus \u2013 ruled \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d by the supreme court more than 10 months ago \u2013 and that men had been held there for more than three years. \u201cIt is so tragic and shocking,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause Australia is first-world country and a pretender [to uphold] human rights. But this behaviour with refugees and asylum seekers is completely against humanity.\u201d The play deals with violence in the island camps and the deterioration of the protagonists\u2019 mental and physical health. But the show does not aim to preach, Sahamizadeh insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve mostly tried to give audiences awareness and make them think, instead of giving them just message.\u201d She said people brought, and left with, different attitudes towards the issue of irregular migration and of those who seek asylum. \u201cSome believe that refugees should not use illegal ways and government has right to deal with them but the majority are saying that these camps should be closed and government should not act like this.\u201d She said the play, despite its controversial subject matter \u2013 Iran\u2019s theocratic regime is sensitive to the issue of its citizens fleeing to claim protection and refuses to accept failed asylum seekers forcibly returned to its territory \u2013 has not attracted the attention, nor opprobrium, of authorities. \u201cMy play is a social show and not political and is for ordinary people and not authorities.\u201d Hossein Babaahmadi, a former asylum seeker held on Manus who has since returned to Iran, spoke at a performance of the play, telling the audience he was still suffering from his time seeking asylum and in detention. \u201cOnly those who been through this can imagine this journey \u2026 every single moment of it was like death.\u201d",

Many of the routines of a suburban childhood will be immediately recognisable to readers, except that the colour of Maxine Beneba Clarke\u2019s skin makes her the target for an astonishing level of discrimination. The combination of a familiar Australian childhood and a world of bullying, ostracism and casual racism is necessarily shocking, transforming this memoir into a significant indictment of cultural complacency.

It is also a murder mystery that deftly transforms the genre, focusing on the family and friends of the victim rather than the crime itself, and tactically diminishing the perpetrator in a careful withdrawal from the sensational.

Emily Maguire cleverly ties together the experiences of Chris and May, bringing into play the impact of Bella\u2019s murder on other members of the community.

The profits go back to Growing Abundance to invest in local food initiatives such as their harvest program and school canteen project. Valentini hopes future profits will also support local farmers through advocacy and local government procurement policy development. </p> <p>Despite being involved with Growing Abundance for years, Valentini has been surprised by the response to the cafe. \u201cNow that we have a physical space it has changed the way the community interacts with us,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many people are asking what they can do to help so, in that way, it\u2019s not just a business \u2013 there\u2019s a wider ownership of the space.\u201d As if on cue, the owner of the local dance studio pops her head around the door and brings in some wooden chairs and a table she is donating to the cafe. </p> <p>For Valentini, social enterprises in rural areas thrive because of the desire for connection and community. \u201cIn small country towns, people like something that binds them,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Australia has a long history of community-owned businesses in rural, regional and remote areas, says Prof Josephine Barraket, director at the Centre of Social Impact at Swinburne University. </p> <p>Barraket conducted focus groups with social enterprises as part of the 2016 <a href=\"http://www.socialtraders.com.au/app/uploads/2016/07/Fases-2016.pdf\">Finding Australia\u2019s Social Enterprise Sector</a> project, which suggested that the diversity of social enterprises is growing in rural and regional areas. <em> </em></p> <p>\u201cRural social enterprises are unique community resources,\u201d Barraket says. \u201cThey often contribute to the connective tissue that keeps local economies sustainable. They offer spaces of wellbeing that support social and economic participation of people in communities and act as community infrastructure by supporting other community organisations through sponsorship, granting or lending their equipment and skills.\u201d</p> <p>While there is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08985626.2015.1030458\">some research</a> that questions whether rural social enterprises create value or simply displace other types of local business, Barraket says there is no evidence of this as a major trend. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/16/victoria-to-spend-5m-in-australias-first-social-enterprise-strategy\">Victoria to spend $5m in Australia's first social enterprise strategy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She offers the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ycdco.com.au/\">Yackandandah Community Development Company</a> as an example. YCDCo, as it is known, was established in 2001 in response to the proposed closure of the only petrol station in the town of 1850 people. \u201cThere was a pressing need to have fuel remain in Yackandandah to underwrite the viability of existing businesses and support residents living and working locally,\u201d the YCDCo director, Phillip Newman, says.</p> <p>Seven local people came together to form YCDCo and it became an unlisted public company.

      "bodyText": "Next to the baskets of plums sitting on the wooden table outside a Castlemaine cafe is a handwritten sign encouraging those passing to help themselves. It seems to be working \u2013 the basket is almost empty. The free fruit is an initiative of The Local, a new social enterprise cafe in Castlemaine in the heart of the Victorian gold fields. Social enterprises are generally defined as businesses that exist to meet a social or environmental purpose and devote the majority of their profit to that cause, rather than maximise private profit. Nikki Valentini is the project manager of Growing Abundance, the non-profit organisation behind The Local. In addition to running the cafe, Growing Abundance run some of the canteens at local schools, a food catering service and a harvest project where volunteers collect fruit from backyards and local orchards that would otherwise go to waste. \u201cThe purpose of the cafe is about eating locally sourced and ethical food with little waste,\u201d Valentini says. The profits go back to Growing Abundance to invest in local food initiatives such as their harvest program and school canteen project. Valentini hopes future profits will also support local farmers through advocacy and local government procurement policy development. Despite being involved with Growing Abundance for years, Valentini has been surprised by the response to the cafe. \u201cNow that we have a physical space it has changed the way the community interacts with us,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many people are asking what they can do to help so, in that way, it\u2019s not just a business \u2013 there\u2019s a wider ownership of the space.\u201d As if on cue, the owner of the local dance studio pops her head around the door and brings in some wooden chairs and a table she is donating to the cafe. For Valentini, social enterprises in rural areas thrive because of the desire for connection and community. \u201cIn small country towns, people like something that binds them,\u201d she says. Australia has a long history of community-owned businesses in rural, regional and remote areas, says Prof Josephine Barraket, director at the Centre of Social Impact at Swinburne University. Barraket conducted focus groups with social enterprises as part of the 2016 Finding Australia\u2019s Social Enterprise Sector project, which suggested that the diversity of social enterprises is growing in rural and regional areas. \u201cRural social enterprises are unique community resources,\u201d Barraket says. \u201cThey often contribute to the connective tissue that keeps local economies sustainable. They offer spaces of wellbeing that support social and economic participation of people in communities and act as community infrastructure by supporting other community organisations through sponsorship, granting or lending their equipment and skills.\u201d While there is some research that questions whether rural social enterprises create value or simply displace other types of local business, Barraket says there is no evidence of this as a major trend. She offers the Yackandandah Community Development Company as an example. YCDCo, as it is known, was established in 2001 in response to the proposed closure of the only petrol station in the town of 1850 people. \u201cThere was a pressing need to have fuel remain in Yackandandah to underwrite the viability of existing businesses and support residents living and working locally,\u201d the YCDCo director, Phillip Newman, says. Seven local people came together to form YCDCo and it became an unlisted public company. The enterprise is entirely owned by the local community, with residents of Yackandandah making up its shareholder base. While YCDCo\u2019s initial motivation was on securing a fuel supply to the town, its focus has been much wider. The business model ensures half of the profits go to supporting community initiatives such as publishing the local community newspaper and sponsoring community awards. \u201cWe pay about $250,000 in wages to locals each year and have an employment policy which focuses on local youth,\u201d Newman says. \u201cOther than the substantial financial contributions the company has made to the township in the form of wages, dividends and supporting local initiatives, there is definitely a sense of pride in what has been achieved.\u201d It\u2019s this vision that appeals to Rebel Black. Black is the founder of The Hungry Spirit, a social enterprise based in Lightning Ridge in north-western New South Wales. \u201cThe Hungry Spirit was borne out of a desire to share knowledge and wisdom about growing food in semi-arid Australia,\u201d she says.

      "body": "<p>In Paris in January, Unifrance \u2013 an organisation promoting French film abroad \u2013 held its annual conference, Rendez-vous with French Cinema. Invited to cover it for Australian readers, I was struck by an unusual commonality: almost every film I watched revolved around a woman, or women, at work. <br /></p> <p>The French actor Nathalie Baye has <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20101206-cinema-film-exclusive-interview-nathalie-baye-french-actress\">spoken before</a> about the opportunities presented to older women in the industry. She told me: \u201cWe are fortunate in France. Cinema here is more inspired by real life, and for women, real life doesn\u2019t stop at the age of 45. In fact, there\u2019s more going on \u2013 and more interesting things happening to them.\u201d </p> <p>The Alliance Fran\u00e7aise French film festival opens this week, and brings a number of these films to Australian shores. I\u2019ve focused here on the talking points and highlights, paying particular attention to those that are likely to receive a wider release \u2013 but with 200 films made each year in France (compared with 30 or so in Australia), and 43 of them coming to Australia for the festival, this list is far from comprehensive.</p> <p>There are <a href=\"http://www.affrenchfilmfestival.org/film/lost-in-paris\">slapstick</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/13/ma-loute-slack-bay-review-juliette-binoche-cannes-2016-bruno-dumont\">comedies</a>, <a href=\"http://www.affrenchfilmfestival.org/film/being-17\">queer coming-of-age</a> stories, <a href=\"http://www.affrenchfilmfestival.org/film/the-first-the-last\">Belgium-set satires</a>, and at least one movie starring <a href=\"http://www.affrenchfilmfestival.org/film/saint-amour\">G\u00e9rard Depardieu and a heap of wine</a>.

Like the previous two, the latest revolves around a son\u2019s complicated relationship with his mother \u2013 but this is his biggest cast to date.</p> <p>Based on a play by Jean-Luc Lagarce, It\u2019s Only the End of the World is a stunning slow burn. Louis (Ulliel), an acclaimed gay playwright in his mid-30s, returns to his estranged family to try to tell them he is dying of a terminal illness, but instead is thrown back into the pressure cooker of tension, anxiety and resentment that caused him to leave them 12 years ago.</p> <p>The film is shot so tight you feel you can\u2019t escape the characters and their dysfunction: his lonely younger sister Suzanne (Seydoux), his awful, aggressive brother Antoine (Cassel), Antoine\u2019s sad wife, Catherine (an underused Cotillard), and his manic, heartbreaking mother Martine, played by Baye (who also stars in <a href=\"http://www.affrenchfilmfestival.org/film/moka\">Moka</a> at this year\u2019s festival). </p> <p>Although it went on to be awarded the Cannes grand prix and three Cesars, the film divided critics upon its premiere. As Baye told Guardian Australia in January, Dolan had it coming: \u201cAt some point [the critics] have to pull people down \u2013 they don\u2019t want to go on and be too encouraging.\u201d</p> <p><strong>You might also like: </strong><a href=\"http://www.affrenchfilmfestival.org/film/just-to-be-sure\">Just To Be Sure</a>, directed by Carine Tardieu</p> <p>Tardieu\u2019s third feature also has at its centre a deeply complicated family.

The Midwife (\u201csage femme\u201d in French, which translates to \u201cwise woman\u201d) is a soft study of midwife Claire (Frot) who is passionate about her job and excels at it. Her quiet life is thrown into chaos when her father\u2019s ex \u2013 an extravagant, alcoholic, gambling-addicted woman played brilliantly by Deneuve \u2013 gets in touch with Claire out of the blue, three decades after breaking her dad\u2019s heart.<br /></p> <p>At its centre, the film is about the complex, fragile relationship between these two older women. But interwoven in their subtle story are broader social themes, as Claire\u2019s craft is threatened by the money-driven modern birthing industry \u2013 sterile, efficient and lacking in heart.</p> <p>Some of the babies in this film are so new that they\u2019re blue; the film crew and Frot were present at their births. Frot went through a midwifery course for the film, and actually caught a few of the babies herself \u2013 emotional moments for the actor and the crew, and Provost said there were more than a few tears.</p> <p><strong>If you like this, you might also like: </strong><a href=\"http://www.affrenchfilmfestival.org/film/the-country-doctor\">The Country Doctor</a>, directed by Thomas Lilti</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/12/irreplaceable-review-francois-cluzet\">Irreplaceable review \u2013 good-natured country doctor drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Titled Irreplaceble in other regions, The Country Doctor is another heartwarming French drama about a dedicated doctor (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet), who must find and train a replacement to treat his community before his ill health takes hold.

Depp, who also stars opposite Natalie Portman in <a href=\"http://www.affrenchfilmfestival.org/film/planetarium\">Planetarium</a>, here plays Isadora Duncan: the talented, beautiful prodigy who threatens to topple Fuller from the throne. </p> <p>The plot and script tilts towards the cringeworthy but some of the dance sequences are spell-binding and the two lead actors are compelling, particularly when they share a scene \u2013 between the dark Fuller and her manipulative young protege, the tension is palpable. </p> <p><strong>If you like this, you might also like: </strong><a href=\"http://www.affrenchfilmfestival.org/film/polina\">Polina</a>, directed by Angelin Preljocaj</p> <p>The directorial debut of Angelin Preljocaj, founder of the famous Ballet Preljocaj, Polina tells the fictional story of a working-class girl from Moscow who joins the Bolshoi Ballet, falls in love and channels that passion into movement.

A former communist whose radical ideals have been tempered by age (\u201cEveryone\u2019s a communist for three years,\u201d she says with a shrug at one point), she connects with a group of political young people and rediscovers herself in the process.<br /></p> <p>The film is a tender study of ageing, loss and reinvention \u2013 so complex that it\u2019s difficult to capture in a plot description. Although inspired in part by Hansen-L\u00f8ve\u2019s own life \u2013 her parents, both philosophy teachers, split when she was in her 20s \u2013 Huppert imbues the character with so much pathos and personality it\u2019s hard to see Nathalie as anyone but herself. </p> <p>The actor \u2013 who was nominated for an Oscar for Elle, and received the UniFrance French cinema award this year \u2013 is the biggest name Hansen-L\u00f8ve has worked with to date. Asked at Rendez-vous how she felt to be directing such a talent, the 36-year-old\u2019s answer was relatable and honest: \u201cTerrified. I still am!

Chocolat is marketed in blackface, and in his performance with Footitt plays the dumb, friendly scapegoat who is perennially kicked in the butt as the audience laughs and cheers. It\u2019s difficult to watch but also impossible not to \u2013 both performers are masters at movement and their lively clowning is uncomfortably hilarious.</p> <p>But it\u2019s the threat of tragic ruin for Chocolat that holds the movie together, as the performer\u2019s ambitions collide with his society\u2019s violent constraints \u2013 and his own addictions. </p> <p> <strong>If you like this, you might also like:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.affrenchfilmfestival.org/film/ogres\">Ogres</a>, directed by L\u00e9a Fehner</p> <p> It\u2019s striking how many films at this year\u2019s festival deal with performance, from The Dancer and Polina to Planetarium and Monsieur Chocolat.

      "bodyText": "In Paris in January, Unifrance \u2013 an organisation promoting French film abroad \u2013 held its annual conference, Rendez-vous with French Cinema. Invited to cover it for Australian readers, I was struck by an unusual commonality: almost every film I watched revolved around a woman, or women, at work. The French actor Nathalie Baye has spoken before about the opportunities presented to older women in the industry. She told me: \u201cWe are fortunate in France. Cinema here is more inspired by real life, and for women, real life doesn\u2019t stop at the age of 45. In fact, there\u2019s more going on \u2013 and more interesting things happening to them.\u201d The Alliance Fran\u00e7aise French film festival opens this week, and brings a number of these films to Australian shores. I\u2019ve focused here on the talking points and highlights, paying particular attention to those that are likely to receive a wider release \u2013 but with 200 films made each year in France (compared with 30 or so in Australia), and 43 of them coming to Australia for the festival, this list is far from comprehensive. There are slapstick comedies, queer coming-of-age stories, Belgium-set satires, and at least one movie starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu and a heap of wine. There\u2019s a biopic about Mozart\u2019s sister, another about Marie Antoinette, and a bunch of films nominated for multiple Cesars \u2013 including Slack Bay, the Innocents, and From the Land of the Moon. There is also the requisite smattering of big-budget crowd pleasers, among the biggest names in French cinema and beyond \u2013 from Isabelle Huppert and Juliette Binoche to Audrey Tatou, Nathalie Portman and Omar Sy. It\u2019s Only the End of the World, directed by Xavier Dolan Starring: Marion Cotillard, Vincent Cassel, Nathalie Baye, Gaspard Ulliel, L\u00e9a Seydoux Showing in: Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide The 27-year-old Canadian director Xavier Dolan has been the wunderkind of French-language cinema since his 2009 debut feature I Killed My Mother; his follow-up, Mommy, won the jury prize at 2014\u2019s Cannes festival. Like the previous two, the latest revolves around a son\u2019s complicated relationship with his mother \u2013 but this is his biggest cast to date. Based on a play by Jean-Luc Lagarce, It\u2019s Only the End of the World is a stunning slow burn. Louis (Ulliel), an acclaimed gay playwright in his mid-30s, returns to his estranged family to try to tell them he is dying of a terminal illness, but instead is thrown back into the pressure cooker of tension, anxiety and resentment that caused him to leave them 12 years ago. The film is shot so tight you feel you can\u2019t escape the characters and their dysfunction: his lonely younger sister Suzanne (Seydoux), his awful, aggressive brother Antoine (Cassel), Antoine\u2019s sad wife, Catherine (an underused Cotillard), and his manic, heartbreaking mother Martine, played by Baye (who also stars in Moka at this year\u2019s festival). Although it went on to be awarded the Cannes grand prix and three Cesars, the film divided critics upon its premiere. As Baye told Guardian Australia in January, Dolan had it coming: \u201cAt some point [the critics] have to pull people down \u2013 they don\u2019t want to go on and be too encouraging.\u201d You might also like: Just To Be Sure, directed by Carine Tardieu Tardieu\u2019s third feature also has at its centre a deeply complicated family. Enjoying its world premiere at the French film festival in Australia, Just To Be Sure follows 45-year-old widower Erwan\u2019s (Fran\u00e7ois Damiens) search to find his biological father. The Midwife, directed by Martin Provost Starring: Catherine Deneuve, Catherine Frot, Olivier Gourmet, Myl\u00e8ne Demongeot Showing in: Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart If I were giving birth, there\u2019s few things I would welcome less than a film crew \u2013 but for the shooting of the Midwife, six women opened their doors. \u201cIt\u2019s awful to see three- or four-month-old babies appearing [in film birth scenes], after this suffering of the mothers,\u201d the director, Martin Provost, explained to Guardian Australia in January. \u201cIn France you can\u2019t film babies under three months old \u2013 so that\u2019s why the shooting took place in Belgium.\u201d Provost himself was saved by his midwife, who donated blood to keep him alive after his birth \u2013 and he has dedicated this film to her. The Midwife (\u201csage femme\u201d in French, which translates to \u201cwise woman\u201d) is a soft study of midwife Claire (Frot) who is passionate about her job and excels at it. Her quiet life is thrown into chaos when her father\u2019s ex \u2013 an extravagant, alcoholic, gambling-addicted woman played brilliantly by Deneuve \u2013 gets in touch with Claire out of the blue, three decades after breaking her dad\u2019s heart. At its centre, the film is about the complex, fragile relationship between these two older women. But interwoven in their subtle story are broader social themes, as Claire\u2019s craft is threatened by the money-driven modern birthing industry \u2013 sterile, efficient and lacking in heart. Some of the babies in this film are so new that they\u2019re blue; the film crew and Frot were present at their births. Frot went through a midwifery course for the film, and actually caught a few of the babies herself \u2013 emotional moments for the actor and the crew, and Provost said there were more than a few tears. If you like this, you might also like: The Country Doctor, directed by Thomas Lilti Titled Irreplaceble in other regions, The Country Doctor is another heartwarming French drama about a dedicated doctor (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet), who must find and train a replacement to treat his community before his ill health takes hold. He is initially distrustful of the inexperienced Nathalie (Isabelle Sadoyan) \u2013 but she soon proves herself. The Dancer, directed by St\u00e9phanie Di Giusto Starring: Soko, Lily-Rose Depp, M\u00e9lanie Thierry, Gaspard Ulliel Showing in: Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, Parramatta, Casula This is not probably the best film you\u2019ll see at this year\u2019s festival but with a cast that includes the French singer and actor Soko and Lily-Rose Depp (daughter of Johnny Depp and the French singer, model and actor Vanessa Paradis), it is certainly a film of interest \u2013 and very pretty to look at. The Dancer is a fairly straightforward, deeply fictionalised account of the life of Lo\u00efe Fuller (Soko): the legendary French dancer who, in the late 1800s, revolutionised the form\u2019s relationship to stagecraft and spectacle with her \u201cserpentine\u201d dance. Depp, who also stars opposite Natalie Portman in Planetarium, here plays Isadora Duncan: the talented, beautiful prodigy who threatens to topple Fuller from the throne. The plot and script tilts towards the cringeworthy but some of the dance sequences are spell-binding and the two lead actors are compelling, particularly when they share a scene \u2013 between the dark Fuller and her manipulative young protege, the tension is palpable. If you like this, you might also like: Polina, directed by Angelin Preljocaj The directorial debut of Angelin Preljocaj, founder of the famous Ballet Preljocaj, Polina tells the fictional story of a working-class girl from Moscow who joins the Bolshoi Ballet, falls in love and channels that passion into movement. Again, the dance scenes performed by ballerina Anastasia Shevtsova are what you\u2019ll be watching it for, as well as the star talent: Juliette Binoche plays one of her instructors. Things to Come, directed by Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve Starring: Isabelle Huppert, Andr\u00e9 Marcon, \u00c9dith Scob, Roman Kolinka Showing in: Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart In the fifth feature from the acclaimed director Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve, Huppert plays Nathalie: a philosopher whose academic husband suddenly leaves her for a younger woman. A former communist whose radical ideals have been tempered by age (\u201cEveryone\u2019s a communist for three years,\u201d she says with a shrug at one point), she connects with a group of political young people and rediscovers herself in the process. The film is a tender study of ageing, loss and reinvention \u2013 so complex that it\u2019s difficult to capture in a plot description. Although inspired in part by Hansen-L\u00f8ve\u2019s own life \u2013 her parents, both philosophy teachers, split when she was in her 20s \u2013 Huppert imbues the character with so much pathos and personality it\u2019s hard to see Nathalie as anyone but herself. The actor \u2013 who was nominated for an Oscar for Elle, and received the UniFrance French cinema award this year \u2013 is the biggest name Hansen-L\u00f8ve has worked with to date. Asked at Rendez-vous how she felt to be directing such a talent, the 36-year-old\u2019s answer was relatable and honest: \u201cTerrified. I still am! And she plays with that, too,\u201d she replied, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s part of her personality. I think that even Michael Haneke at one stage was like, \u2018Gasp! This is Isabelle Huppert, right in front of me! I\u2019d better behave!\u2019 \u2026 But on the other hand it was very easy to work with her. We trusted one another fully.\u201d If you like this, you might like: Souvenir, directed by Bavo Defurne OK, the only real connection between these two films are in its lead actor \u2013 but if you\u2019re a fan of Huppert you\u2019ll want to watch Souvenir, which the Guardian\u2019s Benjamin Lee has described as \u201cone of her strangest-sounding projects yet, and that\u2019s quite a statement for Huppert\u201d. In the film, she plays a bored pat\u00e9 factory worker who was once a Eurovision finalist \u2013 and who is encouraged to return to the stage after being recognised by a young man. The Unknown Girl, directed by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne Starring: Ad\u00e8le Haenel, Olivier Bonnaud, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier, Louka Minnella Showing in: Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide Like Two Days, One Night before it, the latest film by Belgium\u2019s Dardenne brothers \u2013 the double Palme-winning team known for their social realist masterpieces \u2013 is set in their favoured town of Li\u00e8ge and follows the quest of a young woman.

The rest of the film is Jenny\u2019s conscience-driven pilgrimage to find out who that woman is. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw called the film a \u201crare misfire\u201d from the brothers, with a plot that depends too much on coincidence to be plausible, and doesn\u2019t offer much more than a by-the-book crime drama. But I enjoyed the performance of Haenel, who plays Jenny with such impassivity and stoicism that each facial tic and bodily slump carries weight. At Rendez-vous in Paris, Jean-Pierre Dardenne acknowledged that your enjoyment of the film depends on how much you get from her performance: \u201cWhat [Jenny] does with her responsibility \u2026 also says something about [the] world. But it only says something about the world if you\u2019re really interested in her character.\u201d If you like this you might like: Standing Tall, directed by Emmanuelle Bercot For the coveted opening-night slot of Cannes film festival, the 2015 programmers eschewed the usual star power and glamour for a movie that had much more to say with less. In Bercot\u2019s social realist drama, Catherine Deneuve plays a juvenile court judge who, with a tough but kindhearted counsellor (Beno\u00eet Magimel), attempts to rehabilitate a young delinquent. Tomorrow, directed by M\u00e9lanie Laurent Showing in: Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Casula The renowned actor and film-maker M\u00e9lanie Laurent was pregnant with her first child when she came across a terrifying study. Coordinated by the biologist Elisabeth Hadley and the paleontologist Tony Barnosky in 2012, the research \u2013 signed by 21 scientists \u2013 predicted that if the way we treated the Earth didn\u2019t change, we were heading towards a tipping point of mass extinction as severe as the last glacial shift 11,000 years ago. Terrified into action, Laurent teamed up with the ecological rights advocate Cyril Dion and a group of fresh-faced film-making friends, who travel around the world in search of real solutions to climate change. \u201cWe all felt we had to do something,\u201d Laurent says in the opening sequence of her documentary, which has a Captain-Planet-meets-Vice kind of feel. The facts are as well-researched as they are sobering but it\u2019s shot with a playfulness and youthful vitality that stops Tomorrow from becoming too overbearing. And it\u2019s refreshing to see a documentary focused less on problems than on real-world solutions \u2013 perhaps one reason why Tomorrow has done so well at the French box office. If you like this you might like: The Odyssey, directed by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salle As a super-commercial biopic, The Odyssey has more in common with the Dancer and Monsieur Chocolat than it does with Tomorrow \u2013 but I\u2019ve hemmed myself in with this listicle format and we\u2019ll have to make do. Another globetrotting celebration of the planet, this \u20ac20m film follows three decades in the life of the celebrity oceanographer, film-maker and knitted red hat-wearer Jacques Cousteau (referenced in Wes Anderson\u2019s The Life Aquatic, and played here by Lambert Wilson).

Monsieur Chocolat, directed by Roschdy Zem Starring: Omar Sy, James Thierr\u00e9e, No\u00e9mie Lvovsky, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pierrot Appearing at: Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, Casula Another big-budget biopic, Monsieur Chocolat stars French royalty Omar Sy (The Intouchables) as the Afro-Cuban performance artist Rafael Padilla: the first famous black clown, who arrived on main stages during the racist turn of the 20th century. Rafael is cast as a horrific \u201chalf-man/half-animal\u201d caged freak in a roving circus, when he is discovered by the once-celebrated performer George Footitt (played by Charlie Chaplin\u2019s equally-wiggly grandson James Thi\u00e9rr\u00e9). Footitt christens him \u201cChocolat\u201d and has a proposition: a groundbreaking two-hander clown show that pairs Footitt as the Clown Blanc and Chocolat as Auguste. Like The Dancer, this film is more \u201cbased on\u201d a true story than true story itself: in reality, Chocolat was discovered by the famous Auguste Tony Grice before going on to work with Footitt \u2013 just one of many complexities that have been glossed over here. But the film doesn\u2019t gloss over the racism, a theme which, according to Le Monde\u2019s Thomas Sotinel, is unusual for French cinema. Chocolat is marketed in blackface, and in his performance with Footitt plays the dumb, friendly scapegoat who is perennially kicked in the butt as the audience laughs and cheers. It\u2019s difficult to watch but also impossible not to \u2013 both performers are masters at movement and their lively clowning is uncomfortably hilarious. But it\u2019s the threat of tragic ruin for Chocolat that holds the movie together, as the performer\u2019s ambitions collide with his society\u2019s violent constraints \u2013 and his own addictions. If you like this, you might also like: Ogres, directed by L\u00e9a Fehner It\u2019s striking how many films at this year\u2019s festival deal with performance, from The Dancer and Polina to Planetarium and Monsieur Chocolat. Ogres is another, this time centring on a chaotic, claustrophobic travelling theatre troupe and their tumultuous relationships. Based on a similar group Fehner grew up among, the free-spirited performers are played by the director\u2019s own mother, father and sister, along with a handful of others \u2013 but the standout performance is from Ad\u00e8le Haenel as Mona, a young performer who falls pregnant to the troupe\u2019s ringmaster. \u2022 The Alliance Fran\u00e7aise French film festival opens in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra this week, before travelling to Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, Parramatta and Casula \u2022 Guardian Australia travelled to Rendez-vous as a guest of Unifrance",

      "bodyText": "The former Queensland premier Campbell Newman has taken a swipe at his former treasurer Tim Nicholls after the now opposition leader sought to disown the Liberal National party\u2019s \u201cmistakes of the past\u201d. In a Queensland Media Club speech on Tuesday Nicholls apologised to Queensland voters for a Newman government that \u201clet them down\u201d. He said that in the \u201curgency\u201d of Newman government moves \u2013 which included large public service cuts and a push to privatise state port and power assets \u2013 \u201cwe failed to explain and take Queenslanders with us on the journey\u201d. \u201cI acknowledge that we broke the trust of Queenslanders and for that I am sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cMy style is different. I wasn\u2019t in charge last time.\u201d Newman, who was bundled out of his own seat when the LNP lost government in 2015, shot back on Twitter, accusing Nicholls of evading responsibility for driving the unpopular privatisation campaign and public service cuts. He followed up by further mocking Nicholls\u2019 attempt to distance himself from the LNP government decisions, and challenging him to spell out how his policies were different. Nicholls did not respond. But the Queensland treasurer, Curtis Pitt, was happy to back Newman, tweeting that Nicholls was pretending the \u201cfailed LNP Govt wasn\u2019t his fault\u201d. \u201cEither he was a Treasurer with no influence or has amnesia,\u201d Pitt said Nicholls, who has been under pressure amid the threat of losing conservative voters to an increasingly popular One Nation, dismissed Pauline Hanson\u2019s party as one that would fall apart through \u201cthought bubbles and uncosted promises\u201d. He repeated his line that the LNP would \u201cnot form a coalition with One Nation\u201d, but declined to answer a follow-up question about accepting its support to form a minority government. Newman months ago said the price of forming government with One Nation support would be giving the populist rightwing party cabinet positions. Nicholls said he would \u201cdraw the line right here and now between us and them\u201d. \u201cOne Nation might be good at spelling out the problems but those problems require more than a thought bubble to fix them,\u201d he said. \u201cThought bubbles and uncosted promises won\u2019t create a single extra job, protect our most vulnerable or build a better future for our state. They talk and disintegrate. That is their record.\u201d But Nicholls also suggested One Nation\u2019s success at the polls would come at the LNP\u2019s cost and translate into Labor\u2019s return to government in an election due by early 2018. \u201cThe gravest risk to our prosperity is in voting for a minor party \u2026 because they will return a do-nothing Labor government,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we know this? It happened in 1998 and 2001.\u201d The Victorian-born son of a car salesman who was \u201cpart of the first great wave of migration to Queensland by southerners\u201d, Nicholls said he was \u201cready to lead\u201d a state government. He accused the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of being a \u201cfluffy figurehead\u201d apt to \u201cfreeze at the precipice of progress, ordering more than 150 reviews, taskforces and inquiries \u2013 that\u2019s more than six every month \u2013 since coming to office\u201d. \u201cTwo years into her premiership, Queenslanders would just like to see Annastacia Palaszczuk do something. Anything.\u201d He added: \u201cThe trains don\u2019t run on time, our roads are congested, hospital budgets are blowing out, drug and violent crime is snowballing.\u201d But Nicholls said the \u201cgreatest risk confronting Queenslanders today is job security\u201d, stressing that LNP governments were better economic managers. He said the LNP offered \u201ca team with a clear, six-point economic plan for jobs, jobs and jobs\u201d. But Nicholls only referred to six sectors he said were \u201cthe drivers of the state economy \u2013 tourism, resources, agriculture, construction and manufacturing, education, and services, science and technology\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll have more to say about these policies very soon,\u201d he said. The opposition leader said the LNP pledged to \u201csafeguard the Great Barrier Reef for future generations\u201d by forging an alliance of likeminded groups to protect this \u201cnatural wonder\u201d. But in a plan for regional Queensland branded the LNP\u2019s \u201cnew deal\u201d, Nicholls has pledged moves that critics say runs counter to this promise. These include supporting a new \u201ceconomically viable coal-fired power station in north Queensland\u201d, scrapping Labor\u2019s \u201cirresponsible\u201d 2030 renewable energy target of 50%, and opposing tree-clearing restrictions that were a key promise to Unesco in Australia\u2019s reef conservation plan.",

He said \u201cwell-intended\u201d councils were \u201ctrying to explore new technology\u201d but in this case the move provoked \u201csome serious debates about profiling people\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s where I think it can get scary because facial recognition\u2019s not that accurate, mood recognition as Facebook\u2019s trying to run out or whatever Toowoomba is trying to do with behavioural pattern recognition \u2013 all those algorithms have failures,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a wider debate that\u2019s beyond privacy, around the adequacy of the decision-making process based on it and that\u2019s a wider thing for artificial intelligence generally. \u201cIf they\u2019re using a privacy-invasive technology in the first place to base their algorithms on, there\u2019s a few concerns across the board.\u201d Michael Cope, the president of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, said the technology was \u201cstraight out of 1984\u201d and had been linked in the US with a tendency to over-select racial minorities. \u201cThe algorithms which underlie this technology have at their heart arbitrary concepts of what is normal,\u201d Cope said. \u201cPeople are selected for attention by authorities on the basis of their supposedly abnormal behaviour or appearance. \u201cHow would you feel if you are innocently minding your own business in the mall and you are approached by the police in front of everyone because a machine thinks you look odd?\u201d iOmniscient\u2019s Sydney office could not be reached for comment. But the company website details a product called IQ-120 which \u201chas the ability to detect behaviour deemed suspicious such as loitering or running, based on the speed and pattern of their movement\u201d. Staff in CCTV monitoring rooms can \u201cmore closely monitor people whose behaviour seems suspicious, potentially averting crises before they happen\u201d, it says. The software can be customised to identify behaviour a client deems \u201csuspicious for their situation\u201d, it says. It gives the example of tracking potential thieves in car parks by configuring software to \u201crecognise that a normal person would walk directly to their car while generating an alarm for any person that is seen to walk form car to car as they decide which one to steal\u201d. It could also detect \u201caberrant behaviour\u201d such as when \u201ca suicidal person may loiter in one place as they build up courage to blow themselves up, or before they jump off a train platform\u201d. Cope called on Toowoomba council to reveal what data from its records was being \u201cfed in to this software and what data is being fed back into the databases\u201d, adding: \u201cWe object to the creation of vast databases.\u201d The use of behavioural recognition in US airports had resulted in \u201cmany innocent people being harassed by security staff\u201d, he said. \u201cThe problem is that when a machine makes the assessment, the pressure is on for the operator to take action lest they be accused of negligence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is that the number of innocent people being accosted by the authorities will go up.\u201d Green said it was preferable if councils \u201ccould talk to us about it before they roll out\u201d technology that clearly infringed on people\u2019s privacy. This would allow a \u201cprivacy-impact analysis [because] that\u2019s going to be the standard internationally\u201d and an assessment of whether it was \u201cin proportion\u201d with its purpose. It was important that the public was involved in a debate about the \u201cproportionality\u201d of such schemes, he said. The Gold Coast city council has consulted Green\u2019s office on a trial of facial recognition surveillance in the lead-up to the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Green said even with the security risks around such an event, given the high-level presence of law enforcement, he personally wondered \u201cwhether councils should be getting into that sort of thing\u201d. The commissioner is awaiting a detailed response from Moreton Bay regional council to his queries about its rollout of audio recordings with its CCTV camera network last month. He previously said he was concerned the scheme might breach the state\u2019s Information Privacy Act, as well as criminal law in the Invasion of Privacy Act. Cope said Queensland councils with camera surveillance had \u201cconsistently behaved as if the Information Privacy Act does not apply to them\u201d. On Tuesday a Toowoomba councillor, Geoff McDonald, said the trial would give other councils a chance to see potential benefits for crowd management, locating missing objects and helping to find missing people. He said there were \u201cpotential community safety benefits through automatic or early identification of antisocial behaviour and potential safety risks\u201d, according to the Sunshine Coast Daily. McDonald was contacted for further comment.",
