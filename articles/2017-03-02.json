The 2015 film is screening as part of the <a href=\"http://www.transitionsfilmfestival.com/\">Transitions film festival,</a> now travelling around the country.</p> <p>The first-time documentary directors Sean Blacknell and Wayne Walsh have interviewed scientists, futurists, philosophers, sociologists and anthropologists about the promise of a utopian world.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve made this film to create a global forum and bring these problems to life,\u201d Blacknell says.

And the film-makers want to encourage their audience to consider whether they would want to live in such a world.</p> <p>The Oxford Martin school predicts 47% of current jobs are at risk of <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf\">being replaced by robots</a> in the next 25 years. In the film, Blackwell and Walsh identify certain key industries likely to be threatened by automated disruption and come up with the approximate figure of 500 million people who will soon be made redundant.</p> <p> Typically, these statistics are a launching pad for people to speculate about how humanity will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/26/with-robots-is-a-life-without-work-one-wed-want-to-live\">find meaning in a world without labour</a>.

      "bodyText": "GK Chesterton once wrote: \u201cI have long ceased to argue with people who prefer Thursday to Wednesday simply because it is Thursday.\u201d Chesterton was sceptical of what he considered the \u201ccult of progress\u201d \u2013 modernity\u2019s unhealthy preoccupation with technological advancement and scientific development for its own sake. You might wonder what he\u2019d make of today\u2019s futurists, so-called techno progressives and the utopian guarantees promised by the fourth industrial revolution. It\u2019s hard not to channel Chestertonesque thoughts when viewing the documentary The Future of Work and Death, which explores the brave new world of \u201csuper-intelligence, super-longevity and super-happiness\u201d, as one of the documentary\u2019s subjects describes it. The 2015 film is screening as part of the Transitions film festival, now travelling around the country. The first-time documentary directors Sean Blacknell and Wayne Walsh have interviewed scientists, futurists, philosophers, sociologists and anthropologists about the promise of a utopian world. \u201cWe\u2019ve made this film to create a global forum and bring these problems to life,\u201d Blacknell says. And it seems to be doing just that \u2013 the pair has learned the film will be screened at the European Commission. Pivoting off Benjamin Franklin\u2019s famous line, \u201cnothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes\u201d, the documentary imagines a world where neither is necessary. And the film-makers want to encourage their audience to consider whether they would want to live in such a world. The Oxford Martin school predicts 47% of current jobs are at risk of being replaced by robots in the next 25 years. In the film, Blackwell and Walsh identify certain key industries likely to be threatened by automated disruption and come up with the approximate figure of 500 million people who will soon be made redundant. Typically, these statistics are a launching pad for people to speculate about how humanity will find meaning in a world without labour. Although the film does tackle these questions, it also encourages viewers to think about what will happen to the half billion-odd workers facing sudden redundancy. \u201cWe saw all these futurists, some of them very articulate and very successful but we found they were just becoming too excited without thinking about the global repercussions on very fragile infrastructures in developing countries,\u201d Blacknell says. On this point, the Rise of the Robots author, Martin Ford, is especially prescient. Contrary to many of his fellow interviewees, he argues that technology alone offers no solution to the problems of massive job displacement. Ford believes addressing the challenge will require social and political will to push the boundaries of capitalism \u2013 and although the idea of a universal basic income isn\u2019t explicitly mentioned (it\u2019s to be the subject of Blacknell and Walsh\u2019s next film), it does serve as the backdrop to much of the discussion. The film-makers decided to intersperse interview footage with archival footage, much of it in black and white. This helps to place contemporary questions about work in a deeper historical context. Indeed there have been moments in the past when the rapid expansion of technology has both excited and terrified us. At the 1889 Paris Exhibition, guild artisans were invited to marvel at new labour-saving devices which, as the artisans quickly realised, would destroy their way of life and most likely leave them destitute. Whether they endured or not isn\u2019t easily determined, though several interviewees acknowledge the enormous job displacement that occurred in this period. Of course, there are strong moral arguments for progress, and Blacknell and Walsh don\u2019t deny the potential benefits. But while The Future of Work and Death encourages viewers to look toward the leading edge of research, it also strongly advises us to keep the other eye on what\u2019s happening right now. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to ask yourself, what\u2019s important on a global scale?\u201d Walsh says. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to focus on the trailing edge [those in poverty] a little bit if you\u2019re going to move forward at such pace.\u201d This is perhaps more significant in the discussion of death. The documentary includes a quote from Bill Gates: \u201cIt seems pretty egocentric while we still have malaria and TB [affecting impoverished communities] for rich people to fund things so they can live longer.\u201d When the documentary turns to mortality and humanity\u2019s attempt to conquer death through longevity, the discussion of what the future is likely to look like gets even more opaque. The film explores two different models of longevity: the attempt to conquer ageing, championed by the gerontologist Aubrey de Grey, and the project of digitally uploading human consciousness so our minds can live on without our bodies. The unifying tenet behind these approaches is the philosophy of transhumanism, a movement that aims to reject the physical and intellectual limitations of humanity in favour of something greater. Given death is humanity\u2019s greatest limitation, the holy grail of transhumanism is immortality. The anthropologist Ernest Becker believed human life was defined by its avoidance of death \u2013 a theme the anthropologists Joanna Cook and Steve Fuller and the writer Will Self explore at length in the documentary. Becker also believed humans strived for immortality, though he thought we were more likely to achieve it through what we created. Instead of actual immortality, Becker believed humans undertake \u201cimmortality projects\u201d to be remembered once they\u2019re gone. There\u2019s a striking coincidence here: at the same time that humanity seeks genuine immortality, we\u2019ve begun to phase out work \u2013 the attempt to fuse our labour with the world to create something new \u2013 perhaps the most common immortality project we\u2019ve created. The irony here is that the transhumanist desire to overcome humanity is motivated by perhaps the most deeply entrenched human instinct there is: survival. The transhumanists claim it is their zeal for life that motivates them. Chesterton\u2019s words again come to mind. \u201cWhen men have come to the edge of a precipice,\u201d he says, \u201cit is the lover of life who has the spirit to leap backwards, and only the pessimist who continues to believe in progress.\u201d Who the optimists and the pessimists are in the fight for humanity\u2019s future remains to be seen, but The Future of Work and Death lends both a soapbox on which to state their case. And as technology takes us closer to either utopia or the cliff, the film helps along a conversation we desperately need to have. \u2022 The Future of Work and Death is part of Transitions film festival, screening nationally",

The recusal came \u2026 Sessions recuses \u2026 after it was revealed that Sessions had met during the campaign with the Russian ambassador, in seeming contradiction of sworn Senate testimony Sessions had given. But Sessions denied that his testimony was off. A big blow to Trump The Russian ambassador apparently sent a staffer to my office, I did not see him, and asked for a meeting \u2026 and we set up a time \u2026 and we met with him \u2026 And we listened to the ambassador, to what his concerns might be. It was just normal things. I don\u2019t remember a lot of it \u2026 \u2013 Attorney general Jeff Sessions Sessions noticeably did not recuse himself from any potential investigation of ties between the Trump administration and Russia, or from other potential inquiries into alleged corruption in the White House. I don\u2019t think so at all. \u2013 Donald Trump, on whether Sessions should recuse himself from investigations into Russian interference in the US election The president flew in a helicopter to the $13bn, 100,000-ton, nuclear-powered warship Gerald R Ford, the country\u2019s biggest, to publicize his plan to update and upgrade the military through a $54bn spending blitz.

      "bodyText": "There is something special in the air at Castleford \u2013 and it is not just the overwhelming smell of malt from local kilns which engulfs this particular part of West Yorkshire these days. For years, the Tigers\u2019 time in and out of Super League has predominantly been about survival, but since Daryl Powell arrived as head coach four years ago, the tide has slowly been turning for one of rugby league\u2019s most historic clubs. A Challenge Cup final in 2014 and three top-five finishes began the turnaround, and many believe this may be the year Castleford finally emerge as title contenders. On this form they are correct to do so. Victories against newly promoted Leigh and Warrington were impressive yardsticks, but at times here, Castleford were unstoppable. There was a moment when Luke Gale was waiting to make it 24-0 when the half-back watched the replay of their fifth try on the big screen and simply stood and applauded \u2013 and how right he was to do so on a night where the Tigers were utterly sublime.

But this was not to say they are the complete team at present, especially coming off the back of one-day and Twenty20 defeats in India.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/02/england-ben-stokes-carlos-brathwaite-west-indies\">England\u2019s Ben Stokes has few fears before Carlos Brathwaite reunion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the latter concluded with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/01/england-india-third-t20-match-report\" title=\"\">an extraordinary collapse</a> of eight for eight in 19 balls in Bangalore, it was the 50-over leg of the tour that proved most informative about the current strengths and weaknesses in the side.</p> <p>England have a lineup that can post monster scores of more than 350, having done so seven times since the last World Cup, and even when Joe Root gave them an injury scare in twisting his ankle during a fielding drill on Thursday, only to later pull up fine, it would have simply seen the form-rich Jonny Bairstow step into the breach.</p> <p>It is with the ball, however, where England are still searching for the wicket\u2011taking prowess that has become mandatory to rein in the thunderbats of the modern game.</p> <p>The seam attack, which sees Steven Finn return for a first cap in a year with Jake Ball still struggling with a knee problem, is a very samey complement of right\u2011arm fast mediums. Morgan was keen to point to the injuries that have denied him the services of David Willey and Reece Topley, as well as the raw pace of Mark Wood.</p> <p>Since the last World Cup the leg\u2011spinner Adil Rashid has been Morgan\u2019s go-to wicket-taker in the middle overs \u2013 just two bowlers in world cricket have claimed more than his 48 victims since the last World Cup \u2013 yet in India he was given just one match in the 50-over series, with his five overs hammered for 50 runs.</p> <p>The England captain insisted Rashid remains his No1, however, and was optimistic that the surfaces in Antigua and Barbados, and the 9.30am starts, will offer more than those in India that saw his bowlers ship more than 1,000 runs in three innings. The challenge, he said, would instead flip back over to his aggressive batsmen.</p> <p>\u201cOur principles as a side will remain the same,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe want to put the opposition under pressure the whole time. But the emphasis here will be getting two \u2018in-men\u2019 at the crease.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s very important because the pitches we\u2019re anticipating playing on, you can lose wickets in clusters and having two in-men taking advantage of their position is going to be key. That doesn\u2019t mean to say we still can\u2019t score 350 or 300. But certainly it won\u2019t be as free-flowing as it has been.\u201d</p> <p>While Morgan said the series was about returning to winning ways before the Champions Trophy at home, the task at hand for West Indies, who miss out on the tournament, is cracking the top eight in the world rankings before 30\u00a0September this year, the cut-off point for automatic qualification to the 2019 World Cup.</p> <p>Only a 3-0 win here would change their lowly position immediately, something that seems a challenge as enormous as their 6ft\u00a07in captain Jason Holder, given his side have won just four of their 17 games so far in the four-year cycle and last emerged as series victors in 2014 at home to Bangladesh.</p> <p>The absence of all but Carlos Brathwaite from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/03/west-indies-win-world-t20-final-carlos-brathwaite-sinks-england\" title=\"\">last year\u2019s World Twenty20-winning side</a> has much been discussed in the lead up to the series \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s gone.

      "bodyText": "Spoilt for choice with the bat but stretched as regards the bowling, is how Eoin Morgan described his England side on the eve of the one-day series with West Indies that gets under way in Antigua on Friday . On paper, Morgan\u2019s men are clear favourites against the ninth-ranked team in the world, with the captain admitting that if they produce their best a 3-0 whitewash is a realistic target. But this was not to say they are the complete team at present, especially coming off the back of one-day and Twenty20 defeats in India. While the latter concluded with an extraordinary collapse of eight for eight in 19 balls in Bangalore, it was the 50-over leg of the tour that proved most informative about the current strengths and weaknesses in the side. England have a lineup that can post monster scores of more than 350, having done so seven times since the last World Cup, and even when Joe Root gave them an injury scare in twisting his ankle during a fielding drill on Thursday, only to later pull up fine, it would have simply seen the form-rich Jonny Bairstow step into the breach. It is with the ball, however, where England are still searching for the wicket\u2011taking prowess that has become mandatory to rein in the thunderbats of the modern game. The seam attack, which sees Steven Finn return for a first cap in a year with Jake Ball still struggling with a knee problem, is a very samey complement of right\u2011arm fast mediums. Morgan was keen to point to the injuries that have denied him the services of David Willey and Reece Topley, as well as the raw pace of Mark Wood. Since the last World Cup the leg\u2011spinner Adil Rashid has been Morgan\u2019s go-to wicket-taker in the middle overs \u2013 just two bowlers in world cricket have claimed more than his 48 victims since the last World Cup \u2013 yet in India he was given just one match in the 50-over series, with his five overs hammered for 50 runs. The England captain insisted Rashid remains his No1, however, and was optimistic that the surfaces in Antigua and Barbados, and the 9.30am starts, will offer more than those in India that saw his bowlers ship more than 1,000 runs in three innings. The challenge, he said, would instead flip back over to his aggressive batsmen. \u201cOur principles as a side will remain the same,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe want to put the opposition under pressure the whole time. But the emphasis here will be getting two \u2018in-men\u2019 at the crease. \u201cThat\u2019s very important because the pitches we\u2019re anticipating playing on, you can lose wickets in clusters and having two in-men taking advantage of their position is going to be key. That doesn\u2019t mean to say we still can\u2019t score 350 or 300. But certainly it won\u2019t be as free-flowing as it has been.\u201d While Morgan said the series was about returning to winning ways before the Champions Trophy at home, the task at hand for West Indies, who miss out on the tournament, is cracking the top eight in the world rankings before 30&nbsp;September this year, the cut-off point for automatic qualification to the 2019 World Cup. Only a 3-0 win here would change their lowly position immediately, something that seems a challenge as enormous as their 6ft&nbsp;7in captain Jason Holder, given his side have won just four of their 17 games so far in the four-year cycle and last emerged as series victors in 2014 at home to Bangladesh. The absence of all but Carlos Brathwaite from last year\u2019s World Twenty20-winning side has much been discussed in the lead up to the series \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s gone.

Where Jones sees a burden, Scotland see an opportunity. When the England head coach speaks of expectation, Scotland talk about enjoyment. And with two hugely impressive wins already in the competition, Scotland are refusing to feel the weight of history. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the most players in the world to choose from, they\u2019ve got the biggest budget in world rugby,\u201d said the defence coach, Matt Taylor. \u201cThey\u2019ve won 17 in a row, they\u2019re second in the world, so maybe Eddie can put his feet up this week.

If both sides play to their maximum, England should claim a record-equalling 18th straight victory.

Sometimes there is a hidden meaning or an agenda they want to push. If you ask us if we\u2019re going to win the game, we can beat anyone on our day if we prepare well. That\u2019s the beauty of sport, we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years the underdog beating the top team in many cases. We\u2019re going to have to prepare well and execute well but there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t win.\u201d</p> <p>For Scotland, this is a unique position to be in. Going into the penultimate round they are still in the hunt for the title and if anyone needed proof of their progress, it is reflected in the latest world rankings and an all-time high of fifth.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been in this position but we\u2019re riding the crest of doing really well,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cSo many times at this point we\u2019ve been out of it. It\u2019s been great to be involved with the team in the last couple of years because you can see the progression. We took some heavy knocks a couple of years ago and we\u2019ve had some tight losses and now we\u2019ve come out the other side.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, we can go down there with the mindset to win, if we execute well, but we know it\u2019s going to be very difficult.

The message from Scotland in response has been clear. Where Jones sees a burden, Scotland see an opportunity. When the England head coach speaks of expectation, Scotland talk about enjoyment. And with two hugely impressive wins already in the competition, Scotland are refusing to feel the weight of history. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the most players in the world to choose from, they\u2019ve got the biggest budget in world rugby,\u201d said the defence coach, Matt Taylor. \u201cThey\u2019ve won 17 in a row, they\u2019re second in the world, so maybe Eddie can put his feet up this week. Who knows?\u201d There can be little chance of that. If both sides play to their maximum, England should claim a record-equalling 18th straight victory. But while Scotland have reached their highest gear in the first half against Ireland and the second against Wales, the defending champions have barely done so throughout and were denied the chance to play any rugby against Italy, according to Jones. Scotland therefore realise that this is among their best chances for a win at Twickenham but are nonetheless content to put the pressure back on Jones\u2019s side. \u201cI don\u2019t think the players [feel a burden of expectation],\u201d said Taylor. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people will be expecting us to win down there but we\u2019re confident in our ability and we\u2019ll go down there confident. \u201cAs coaches, you listen to other coaches\u2019 comments. Sometimes there is a hidden meaning or an agenda they want to push. If you ask us if we\u2019re going to win the game, we can beat anyone on our day if we prepare well. That\u2019s the beauty of sport, we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years the underdog beating the top team in many cases. We\u2019re going to have to prepare well and execute well but there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t win.\u201d For Scotland, this is a unique position to be in. Going into the penultimate round they are still in the hunt for the title and if anyone needed proof of their progress, it is reflected in the latest world rankings and an all-time high of fifth. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been in this position but we\u2019re riding the crest of doing really well,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cSo many times at this point we\u2019ve been out of it. It\u2019s been great to be involved with the team in the last couple of years because you can see the progression. We took some heavy knocks a couple of years ago and we\u2019ve had some tight losses and now we\u2019ve come out the other side. \u201cOf course, we can go down there with the mindset to win, if we execute well, but we know it\u2019s going to be very difficult. It will probably be the most difficult game we\u2019ve played all tournament.\u201d England may be boosted by the return of Billy Vunipola, who is set to make his comeback from a knee injury for Saracens on Sunday, which would only add to the ball-carrying ballast in Jones\u2019s ranks. Taylor has also been impressed by the impact of Ben Te\u2019o, who was among the try scorers on his first England start against Italy, and acknowledged the threat posed by the former rugby league international. \u201cThey\u2019ve got really good carriers all over the field. When you look at the forward pack, anyone in the forward pack carries really well,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be aware of that. I think Ben Te\u2019o has come in and done a good job. He gets them over the gain-line well so we\u2019ll need to be aware of him. \u201cDefensively they are really hard and quick. We\u2019ll have to adapt to that. We\u2019ve got some plans about how we\u2019re going to work our attack. But across the board they\u2019ve got a very good team and the results show that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Laura Muir may be one of the smallest athletes at these European Indoor championships. But over the next three days in Belgrade no one is thinking bigger. In recent months the 23-year-old, who is 5ft&nbsp;3in, has toppled longstanding British and European records as if they were dominoes. Now, however, she is chasing her first major medals the hard way \u2013 by attempting an audacious 1500m and 3,000m double which will involve racing four times in the next three days. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be breaking records,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I want to be one of the big athletes out there with medals against their name. My main goal is to get two golds.\u201d The veterinary student, who shattered Kelly Holmes\u2019s 1500m outdoor British record last summer, has also broken the British indoor 5,000m and European 1,000m and 3,000m marks this winter. On each occasion she wore her fluorescent yellow spikes, which she packed in hand luggage in case her bags got lost. That appeared to be her only worry as she put the finishing touches to her training \u2013 and waved off concerns that she might have attempted to bite off too much. \u201cIt\u2019s probably quite a lot of running,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I train very hard day in and day out, so I don\u2019t see that I won\u2019t be able to cope with it.

      "bodyText": "Green Light, Lorde\u2019s first single since her 2014 Hunger Games tie-in Yellow Flicker Beat, starts off in familiar territory for the 20-year-old New Zealand-born pop prodigy. Over a sparse piano beat, she sings of car-applied makeup and being together yet separate from someone who is \u201ca damn liar\u201d at a bar; spectral backing vocals that recall the choirs accompanying her on earlier singles such as Team spit out lyrics about a great white\u2019s teeth, continuing another poetic motif from her earlier work. But then, the song shifts, turning Technicolor and dragging Lorde on to the dance floor. Urgent house pianos rise in the mix as she sings of hearing \u201csounds in my mind / brand new sounds in my mind\u201d; the backing vocals turn boisterous, sounding like a clutch of dancehall divas who are serving as Lorde\u2019s guardian angels, pulling her toward post-heartbreak redemption.

That&nbsp;should have said \u201cescaped teaching&nbsp;any of the numerous graduates listed\u201d. The author of the letter had spotted his error and sent us a corrected version by email about 10 minutes after the first, but we failed to notice both that and the mistake itself until after the&nbsp;letter was published. \u2022 In the heading on a review of The Tourist, an album by Clap Your Hands Say Yeah (24 February, page 23, G2), we&nbsp;said incorrectly that it was released on the Wichita label. In fact it was issued&nbsp;by Undertow. \u2022 An article about Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (Far-right party loses support in Germany after rift over Nazis, 27 February, page 17) said it had formed only three years ago.

Sessions\u2019 recusal Thursday from investigations pertaining to the 2016 presidential campaigns was a damaging blow for Trump, who said only an hour earlier that he saw no need for the attorney general to take the extraordinary step, just three weeks after his Senate confirmation.

That was when Marvel Studios initiated its ambitious plan to self-finance its movies, buy back the rights to characters such as Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk, and begin the 21st-century wave of superhero films, hugely popular with the public, but often patronised and dismissed the way westerns used to be.</p> <p>But something else happened in 2004: the release of Pixar\u2019s glorious animated superhero homage The Incredibles. That\u2019s a film which doesn\u2019t fit easily into the superhero fanbase-constituency, and is part of neither the Marvel nor DC tribe (unless you count the fact that Pixar, like Marvel, is part of Disney). And I\u2019m conscious that in calling it a \u201chomage\u201d I may even now be denying it full superhero-film status. But a brilliant superhero film is what it is \u2013 riffing on the X-Men and Fantastic Four \u2013 with superb characters, a great supervillain, a terrific story and a sharp satiric theme on the subject of excellence, and the nature of risk, jeopardy and the state.</p> <p>Mr Incredible (voiced by Craig T Nelson) is a lantern-jawed, barrel-chested superhero who plies his trade in the 1940s, the superheroes\u2019 postwar first-generation comic book heyday. He is fighting alongside his fiancee, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter). When a member of the public sues him for preventing his suicide, it triggers a legal nightmare forcing the government to outlaw superheroism and to relocate \u201csupers\u201d to other cities with new identities and bland normality. Twenty years later, he and Elastigirl have suburban lives and he works in insurance \u2013 a nightmarish perversion of his former calling. They have two kids whose superpowers they have to conceal at school. But then a new villain emerges with a secret connection to the Incredibles\u2019 past, forcing them to reclaim their vocation \u2013 and their destiny.</p> <p>It is rightly celebrated for the superhero <em>costumi\u00e8re</em>, Edna Mode, voiced by the director and writer, Brad Bird, who thinks that capes are a bad idea and is passionately committed to her contemporary vision: \u201cI never look back, darling; it distracts from the now.\u201d There is a wonderful passage on the phenomenon of supervillains \u201cmonologuing\u201d \u2013 huge third-act set-piece speeches in which the villains talk about themselves and their awful vision.</p> <p>Actually, in 2017, the non-talky streamlined all-action superhero film is pretty much against both capes and monologuing and also against Edna Mode\u2019s injunction against looking back. Superhero films love origin myths, elaborate retro sequences from the past and all-around ancestor worship.</p> <p>But as it happens, and incredible as it may sound, The Incredibles has a brilliant action sequence, as exciting as anything in any live-action superhero film or action film. Elastigirl and the two kids are flying in their plane to an island from which the errant Mr Incredible has sent a distress signal. Then she is attacked by rockets. The subsequent \u201cchase\u201d scene and midair explosion are absolutely nail-biting.</p> <p>It is witty, smart, visually ravishing, and its generic insights are celebratory, not derisive. What a great superhero film. <strong>PB</strong></p> <h2>Batman</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"966169d878dd97fd2fd5d7746c094d558fec19c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/966169d878dd97fd2fd5d7746c094d558fec19c2/0_104_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Batman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I have to be honest: I am not the world\u2019s biggest superhero movie fan. Put another way, when they took off in the late 80s, I thought they were a fad that would blow over in a few years; more fool me. In fact, the elevation to ever-prolonging ubiquity is one of the great mysteries of contemporary cinema: how this genre, that for years was considered only good for doltish teens, and treated with equivalent lack of respect, has steadily evolved into the mainstay of the global film industry. Be that as it may, I prefer the funny, candy-coloured type of superhero movie (Spider-Man, Thor, Deadpool) rather than the furrowed-brow earnestathons (Batman Begins, Captain America, Man of Steel) \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen a superhero movie weighty or nuanced enough to justify the heavy-duty treatment.<br /></p> <p>But as films \u2013 as opposed to moving comic-books \u2013 superhero movies tend to fall down pretty hard. There are great sequences, brilliant set pieces, very nice shots \u2013 but they rarely hold together, still less allowing actual narrative subtlety to intrude on the scene-shifting. The first \u2013 and still, by my reckoning, only \u2013 time that a superhero movie seemed way ahead of everything else was the first Tim Burton Batman, from 1989. A tour de force of design, cinematography, and cinematic texture, it was light years ahead of (the nevertheless highly enjoyable) Superman films that had blazed the superhero trail in the 1970s and 80s. Burton\u2019s brilliance was to make everything else look redundant \u2013 and in many ways, nothing has changed since. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">AP</strong></p> <h2><strong>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36491036d4556a7f6c897b2113ad280a7294e473\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36491036d4556a7f6c897b2113ad280a7294e473/0_301_5007_3006/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Captain America\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Here\u2019s a conspiracy theory: someone at the Academy purposefully shuffled those envelopes to detract from the much bigger scandal earlier in the evening: the snubbing of Garry Shandling in this year\u2019s Oscars In Memoriam montage.

Plus, vegetables to accompany all that meat and beef: a properly thought-provoking investigation of the morals of surveillance and the ethics of vigilantism in a democratically accountable society.</p> <p>But perhaps what really clinched it for me as an Avengers movie I could get along with was the relative dearth of Robert Downey Jr. The more you can minimise this man, the more I shall like any movie. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>Thor: The Dark World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47c1873f17f44ec41a97977b1eef673d7ce3c468\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47c1873f17f44ec41a97977b1eef673d7ce3c468/0_226_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Many are hailing Logan for stretching the boundaries of what a superhero movie can be.

His 2009 adaptation of Alan Moore\u2019s sprawling graphic novel about an alternative 1980s in which Nixon remains in power and superheroes are real remains a high point of the film-maker\u2019s career \u2013 and proof that given a decent script, he is capable of producing eye-popping cinema beyond that of most his contemporaries. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h24D87SqaLQ\">The bravura opening montage</a>, set to the strains of Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A Changin\u2019, is unequalled in comic book movies. The casting is impeccable: Jackie Earl Haley has never been better than as the hardboiled, morally immovable vigilante Rorschach, a gurning, spitting man out of time whose psychological torment is written on his face whether wearing that famous mask or not. Patrick Wilson is wonderfully understated as the taciturn Nite Owl, a superhero who looks like an accountant with middle-aged spread, while Jeffrey Dean Morgan is perfect as the leering, sneering, cigar-smoking alpha male scumbag the Comedian, a role which surely won him the part of the villain Negan in The Walking Dead. </p> <p>Naysayers argue that Watchmen is too close to its source material, bar a sensibly altered denouement. But Moore\u2019s story is so epic in scale and splendid in its unexpectedly detailed rendering of the inner psyches of costumed crimefighters that Snyder was really only required to add visual flare. If there is a Citizen Kane of superhero movies, this is indisputably it. <strong>BC</strong></p> <h2><strong>X-Men: Days of Future Past</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"372eaebdb01d68ae6f57c32c28716900705a7fd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/372eaebdb01d68ae6f57c32c28716900705a7fd8/313_670_2776_1666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Days of Future Past\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The best thing about this time traveling entry into the vast annals of X-Men history is the absolute disregard Bryan Singer had for newcomers. If you hadn\u2019t been paying attention to his line of mutant entertainment over the last decade or so, you\u2019d feel a bit like Kyle Reese being spat out into 1984 with no clothes and no idea what was happening. That slightly manic pace, which feels like it\u2019s borrowed from a daytime soap opera, plus the period costume and references to Vietnam, Nixon and the height of 70s cold war paranoia made this a strangely daring superhero film. </p> <p>Instead of something that tried to set out the basic idea of what the X-Men were and what they were all about \u2013 a concept most grandmothers could probably grasp by now \u2013 this just got straight into the internal machinations of a group that makes the EU look harmonious. Of course, the old themes of good and evil doing battle, and overcoming personal demons (in this case addiction for Professor X) are there, but it was delivered in a knowingly strange way. You could even argue the hectic feel and funny but slightly smug lines set the stage for the least superhero-y superhero of them all, Deadpool. Singer knew fans were au fait with the concept of time travel, and would love to see Magneto and Professor X as their younger selves, so he threw it all into a blender and Days of Future Past came out like a perfectly mixed bit of superhero bechamel. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">LB</strong></p>",

It might be to blame for the dreary drudgery that\u2019s bogged down many ensuing superhero adventures but it remains a ruthlessly entertaining example of just how daring and necessary the genre can be. BL Watchmen It may be difficult to credit given Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice recently picked up a gaggle of Razzies, but Zack Snyder was once seen as the coming man of comic book movies. His 2009 adaptation of Alan Moore\u2019s sprawling graphic novel about an alternative 1980s in which Nixon remains in power and superheroes are real remains a high point of the film-maker\u2019s career \u2013 and proof that given a decent script, he is capable of producing eye-popping cinema beyond that of most his contemporaries. The bravura opening montage, set to the strains of Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A Changin\u2019, is unequalled in comic book movies. The casting is impeccable: Jackie Earl Haley has never been better than as the hardboiled, morally immovable vigilante Rorschach, a gurning, spitting man out of time whose psychological torment is written on his face whether wearing that famous mask or not. Patrick Wilson is wonderfully understated as the taciturn Nite Owl, a superhero who looks like an accountant with middle-aged spread, while Jeffrey Dean Morgan is perfect as the leering, sneering, cigar-smoking alpha male scumbag the Comedian, a role which surely won him the part of the villain Negan in The Walking Dead. Naysayers argue that Watchmen is too close to its source material, bar a sensibly altered denouement. But Moore\u2019s story is so epic in scale and splendid in its unexpectedly detailed rendering of the inner psyches of costumed crimefighters that Snyder was really only required to add visual flare. If there is a Citizen Kane of superhero movies, this is indisputably it. BC X-Men: Days of Future Past The best thing about this time traveling entry into the vast annals of X-Men history is the absolute disregard Bryan Singer had for newcomers. If you hadn\u2019t been paying attention to his line of mutant entertainment over the last decade or so, you\u2019d feel a bit like Kyle Reese being spat out into 1984 with no clothes and no idea what was happening. That slightly manic pace, which feels like it\u2019s borrowed from a daytime soap opera, plus the period costume and references to Vietnam, Nixon and the height of 70s cold war paranoia made this a strangely daring superhero film. Instead of something that tried to set out the basic idea of what the X-Men were and what they were all about \u2013 a concept most grandmothers could probably grasp by now \u2013 this just got straight into the internal machinations of a group that makes the EU look harmonious. Of course, the old themes of good and evil doing battle, and overcoming personal demons (in this case addiction for Professor X) are there, but it was delivered in a knowingly strange way. You could even argue the hectic feel and funny but slightly smug lines set the stage for the least superhero-y superhero of them all, Deadpool. Singer knew fans were au fait with the concept of time travel, and would love to see Magneto and Professor X as their younger selves, so he threw it all into a blender and Days of Future Past came out like a perfectly mixed bit of superhero bechamel.

Teams and drivers were allowed to post videos to social media for the first time from the track in Barcelona, an act that was strictly <em>verboten</em> under Bernie, as was anything that even remotely might infringe on selling broadcasting rights. Yet it was an unqualified success and can only be to the sport\u2019s advantage.</p> <p>Suddenly there was access to far more coverage, information and insight than ever before and the sense of connection to and interest in F1 will have grown as a consequence, as will the potential for creating new fans \u2013 an absolutely crucial goal.</p> <p>Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, told me he was right behind the move. \u201cThe engagement we have had has been enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe nearly crashed the Red Bull servers with the influx of following and that is purely an advertisement for what\u2019s coming. The broadcasters won\u2019t miss out from that, they\u2019ll gain because people will think: \u2018OK, I want to see what goes on\u2019 and we are able to get across the personalities of the drivers. What did Daniel Ricciardo have for breakfast, how does he prepare before he gets in the car \u2013 people are content hungry.\u201d</p> <p>A positive move backed up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jan/27/formula-one-f1-bernie-ecclestone-british-grand-prix\">by some innovative thinking as Ross Brawn</a> floated the idea of non-championship races to experiment with new formats while he was in Barcelona \u2013 these are small but positive steps and in a long conversation I enjoyed with Brawn his eagerness and commitment to improving the experience for fans was hugely encouraging. Sudden structural change is definitely not coming to F1 but addressing these issues is going to happen and it will occur sooner rather than later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/01/f1-could-reintroduce-non-championship-race-ross-brawn-motor-sport\">F1 may reintroduce non-championship race, says Ross Brawn</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Overtaking under fire</h2> <p>The questions over the effect on overtaking from the new regulations began long before the cars finally hit the track for the first test. Lewis Hamilton brought it up back in November and from the moment that a downforce-based aero-formula, intended to increase speeds and lower lap times, was revealed the potential for it to have an impact on the ability to pass cars on track was clear.</p> <p>Dirty air \u2013 turbulent wakes from the aerodynamics of the car in front \u2013 has long been a known issue in F1, indeed the very existence of DRS is partly down to finding a way to enable cars to get round it, but in Barcelona the added aero of 2017 has raised serious concerns over it genuinely detracting from the racing. Hamilton, who had warned twice in the week before testing that it would be an issue, again brought it up after his first run in the Mercedes W08.</p> <p>\u201cI was behind a couple of cars out there and it was harder to follow, as we expected,\u201d he said, and he was swiftly joined by Williams\u2019 Felipe Massa. \u201cDefinitely from the driving point of view, it\u2019s much nicer for the driver,\u201d said the Brazilian. \u201cFor the show, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure it will be more difficult to overtake.\u201d</p> <p>Three days later, after his final run on a dry track, Hamilton was even more sceptical. \u201cWhen the design came out the engineers said this is the wrong design, this is the wrong way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you are behind it feels one way for a second then you have a crosswind you\u2019re not expecting or you lose front-end grip and you have to lift and then you never get close enough. I\u2019ve experienced that here, I was behind several different cars and it was not easy.\u201d This is not a good sign for the new season. Lower lap times and increased cornering speeds are nice for drivers but it will not be particularly noticeable to fans tuning in on a Sunday afternoon. However, if they are confronted by cars that cannot pass one another on track it will be all too clear and all too embarrassing for the sport. Worryingly, Hamilton has now used the phrase \u201cdon\u2019t hold your breath\u201d in reference to seeing overtaking twice in the space of less than 10 days.</p> <h2>Putting in the miles</h2> <p>Lap times at the first test cannot be invested with too much significance. No one is looking to set out-of-the-box quick times with a brand new car on its first shake down and doubly so when the car is in its first year of development. The teams admit as much. Getting on track, ironing out glitches and top-to-bottom system checks are the order of the day and that is achieved through putting in the miles. Here we can see some genuine results.</p> <p>Ominously, the Mercedes was absolutely rock solid from its first time out of the garage and remained so, barring some minor glitches on the last day. They completed 152 laps on Monday, 168 on Tuesday, 170 on Wednesday and 68 on the final day \u2013 the latter with more limited running due to an \u201celectrical fault\u201d that excused Hamilton from running in a wet session he had been less than keen to do anyway.</p> <p>Those runs included two full, race-length simulations by Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas, the Finn\u2019s on the second day, a remarkable effort for the debut of a new machine. Mercedes will have begun development of the W08 early, given the dominance they enjoyed last season and that will have helped but they have also clearly managed to ensure they have carried over the extraordinary reliability of the previous car to this year\u2019s model.</p> <p>Ferrari, too, will be buoyed by some really consistent running. The Scuderia managed 128 laps on Monday, 108 on Tuesday, 139 on Wednesday and 93 on the final day \u2013 this is just the start they needed; exploring the limits of the car\u2019s potential in speed and tuning its setup can now be the focus for the second test. That was the least that was needed should they want to take the fight to Mercedes.</p> <p>Red Bull in turn had a few problems, completing 50 laps on Monday, 89 on Tuesday, 70 on Wednesday and 85 on the final day, but were on an upward curve throughout the week and Daniel Ricciardo was optimistic that they too would begin unlocking the real potential of the RB13 at the next test.</p> <p>As for McLaren, to have to replace one power unit on day one might be misfortune but a second on day two as well looks like carelessness. It\u2019s too early for them to panic but alarm bells could and should be ringing. And those times? Oh, go on then. Bottas and his Merc was fastest overall with a 1.19.705 which was just two-tenths up on Sebastian Vettel\u2019s Ferrari. Intriguingly, and here let the glorious conjecture begin, the German set his time on the harder, soft tyres ...</p>",

Forward into the future Signs that new owner Liberty Media is taking Formula One into new territory are welcome after years of stagnation under Bernie Ecclestone and CVC and how small things can sometimes make such a big difference. Teams and drivers were allowed to post videos to social media for the first time from the track in Barcelona, an act that was strictly verboten under Bernie, as was anything that even remotely might infringe on selling broadcasting rights. Yet it was an unqualified success and can only be to the sport\u2019s advantage. Suddenly there was access to far more coverage, information and insight than ever before and the sense of connection to and interest in F1 will have grown as a consequence, as will the potential for creating new fans \u2013 an absolutely crucial goal. Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, told me he was right behind the move. \u201cThe engagement we have had has been enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe nearly crashed the Red Bull servers with the influx of following and that is purely an advertisement for what\u2019s coming. The broadcasters won\u2019t miss out from that, they\u2019ll gain because people will think: \u2018OK, I want to see what goes on\u2019 and we are able to get across the personalities of the drivers. What did Daniel Ricciardo have for breakfast, how does he prepare before he gets in the car \u2013 people are content hungry.\u201d A positive move backed up by some innovative thinking as Ross Brawn floated the idea of non-championship races to experiment with new formats while he was in Barcelona \u2013 these are small but positive steps and in a long conversation I enjoyed with Brawn his eagerness and commitment to improving the experience for fans was hugely encouraging. Sudden structural change is definitely not coming to F1 but addressing these issues is going to happen and it will occur sooner rather than later. Overtaking under fire The questions over the effect on overtaking from the new regulations began long before the cars finally hit the track for the first test. Lewis Hamilton brought it up back in November and from the moment that a downforce-based aero-formula, intended to increase speeds and lower lap times, was revealed the potential for it to have an impact on the ability to pass cars on track was clear. Dirty air \u2013 turbulent wakes from the aerodynamics of the car in front \u2013 has long been a known issue in F1, indeed the very existence of DRS is partly down to finding a way to enable cars to get round it, but in Barcelona the added aero of 2017 has raised serious concerns over it genuinely detracting from the racing. Hamilton, who had warned twice in the week before testing that it would be an issue, again brought it up after his first run in the Mercedes W08. \u201cI was behind a couple of cars out there and it was harder to follow, as we expected,\u201d he said, and he was swiftly joined by Williams\u2019 Felipe Massa. \u201cDefinitely from the driving point of view, it\u2019s much nicer for the driver,\u201d said the Brazilian. \u201cFor the show, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure it will be more difficult to overtake.\u201d Three days later, after his final run on a dry track, Hamilton was even more sceptical. \u201cWhen the design came out the engineers said this is the wrong design, this is the wrong way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you are behind it feels one way for a second then you have a crosswind you\u2019re not expecting or you lose front-end grip and you have to lift and then you never get close enough. I\u2019ve experienced that here, I was behind several different cars and it was not easy.\u201d This is not a good sign for the new season. Lower lap times and increased cornering speeds are nice for drivers but it will not be particularly noticeable to fans tuning in on a Sunday afternoon. However, if they are confronted by cars that cannot pass one another on track it will be all too clear and all too embarrassing for the sport. Worryingly, Hamilton has now used the phrase \u201cdon\u2019t hold your breath\u201d in reference to seeing overtaking twice in the space of less than 10 days. Putting in the miles Lap times at the first test cannot be invested with too much significance. No one is looking to set out-of-the-box quick times with a brand new car on its first shake down and doubly so when the car is in its first year of development. The teams admit as much. Getting on track, ironing out glitches and top-to-bottom system checks are the order of the day and that is achieved through putting in the miles. Here we can see some genuine results. Ominously, the Mercedes was absolutely rock solid from its first time out of the garage and remained so, barring some minor glitches on the last day. They completed 152 laps on Monday, 168 on Tuesday, 170 on Wednesday and 68 on the final day \u2013 the latter with more limited running due to an \u201celectrical fault\u201d that excused Hamilton from running in a wet session he had been less than keen to do anyway. Those runs included two full, race-length simulations by Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas, the Finn\u2019s on the second day, a remarkable effort for the debut of a new machine. Mercedes will have begun development of the W08 early, given the dominance they enjoyed last season and that will have helped but they have also clearly managed to ensure they have carried over the extraordinary reliability of the previous car to this year\u2019s model. Ferrari, too, will be buoyed by some really consistent running. The Scuderia managed 128 laps on Monday, 108 on Tuesday, 139 on Wednesday and 93 on the final day \u2013 this is just the start they needed; exploring the limits of the car\u2019s potential in speed and tuning its setup can now be the focus for the second test. That was the least that was needed should they want to take the fight to Mercedes. Red Bull in turn had a few problems, completing 50 laps on Monday, 89 on Tuesday, 70 on Wednesday and 85 on the final day, but were on an upward curve throughout the week and Daniel Ricciardo was optimistic that they too would begin unlocking the real potential of the RB13 at the next test. As for McLaren, to have to replace one power unit on day one might be misfortune but a second on day two as well looks like carelessness. It\u2019s too early for them to panic but alarm bells could and should be ringing. And those times? Oh, go on then. Bottas and his Merc was fastest overall with a 1.19.705 which was just two-tenths up on Sebastian Vettel\u2019s Ferrari. Intriguingly, and here let the glorious conjecture begin, the German set his time on the harder, soft tyres ...",

      "bodyText": "Snap\u2019s arrival on the New York stock exchange is ludicrous in two ways. The first doesn\u2019t matter terribly. If investors want to place a value of $29bn on a five-year-old company that made losses last year of $514m, that\u2019s their lookout. The second is serious. Snap was offering only shares with zero voting rights, which sets an appalling governance example. Technology and social media pioneers already had a shocking record of ignoring the principle that equal economic risk should imply equal voting power. It was poor practice when Google and Facebook floated with shares carrying restricted voting rights, but at least the new co-owners were not entirely frozen out of debates about how the company should be run. Snap\u2019s zero-voting variety offers no possibility that founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy can be held to account should they over-reach themselves in challenging Facebook. Michael Pachter, investment analyst at WedBush, put it well: the governance framework says, in effect, that \u201cyou are a genius and no one should question you\u201d. Snap\u2019s thin justification is that nothing must distract from the single-minded pursuit of the vision of \u201creinventing the camera ... to improve the way people live and communicate\u201d. Whatever that means, it should not involve a governance structure that belongs in the 19th century and would surely be cold-shouldered if attempted in the UK. Yes, US investment bankers will sell most things if the fee is large enough, but the willingness to trample on shareholders\u2019 rights to this degree is breathtaking. So is Snap\u2019s boast that its products \u201cempower people to express themselves\u201d. Its new class of shares does the opposite. Another pre-pack firesale Into administration one minute; out the next. Yes, it\u2019s another pre-pack administration in which the lid is never lifted long enough for outsiders to see what lies within. Mike Ashley is the new owner of lingerie chain Agent Provocateur, paying \u00a330m for the privilege. He is not the first to succeed in one of these speedy sales, but were pre-pack administrations really meant to be a standard technique for selling businesses that have failed to find buyers as a going concern? In other cases, suppliers and landlords have felt short-changed in the rush. An official accounting body ought to have a look. The retail sector, in particular, seems to have adopted pre-packs with an enthusiasm that was never intended.

      "bodyText": "It is a paradox that a country that sought freedom from a king, the United States, is today happy to crown monarchs in commerce. Snap, which calls itself a camera company but is in fact a Silicon Valley firm behind a mobile messaging app, floated on the US stock exchange making billionaires of its two under-30 founders. True, 158 million people open the Snapchat app an average 18 times a day. But money and influence are not the only issues here. It\u2019s also about unaccountable power. Snap\u2019s initial public offering marks a turning point in US capitalism: it is the first time that the only shares on offer are those with no voting rights. This form of techno-aristocratic capitalism means that the founders, 26-year-old Evan Spiegel and 28-year-old Bobby Murphy, will alone make the big decisions about Snap and maintain control over the social media phenomenon even if their employment is terminated. They could retire to an ashram in India or spend the rest of their lives writing haikus. No matter, they will still make every major decision for Snap, from appointing board members to a possible future sale. Only death will release the company from their control. Or if both sell more than 70% of their stock. It\u2019s bizarre that in a country founded on a repudiation of old-world aristocracy, investors are pouring money into creating a nouveau US version of an ancien regime European aristocracy in business, replicating its extravagant and unaccountable wealth. Snap is the worst example of this trend. Silicon Valley is now dominated by companies with weak or passive public shareholders. Many investors have been silly enough to hand over cash for little say in the running of tech titans such as Google, Facebook and Alibaba. Given how quickly today\u2019s heroes are tomorrow\u2019s zeros in technology, it seems foolhardy to cede control to listed companies that sometimes never make a profit or where incumbent managers cannot be fired to make way for new blood. Are investors so gullible that they believe the guff about new gods who see further than anyone else from Olympian-high pedestals \u2013 and are happy to get no dividends from their stock? A greater democratisation of corporates needs the active participation of shareholders to restrain executive compensation and ensure effective scrutiny of directors.

The federal government has been undertaking a review of the 1996 firearms agreement that was put in place after the Port Arthur massacre, prompted in part by the Martin Place siege. A controversial element of the agreement was the classification of lever-action shotguns, particularly the Adler A110 shotgun. The government introduced an import ban on the weapon, sparking intense lobbying efforts from firearms organisations. The ban also caused tensions between the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and his predecessor Tony Abbott, and a rift within Coalition ranks. Despite the political furore around it, the 2017 national firearms agreement was finalised by the Council of Australian Governments in February and quietly posted on the attorney general\u2019s website. It has not been officially announced by George Brandis or the justice minister, Michael Keenan. Lever-action shotguns with a magazine capacity of more than five rounds, including the Adler A110, have been moved to category D which will restrict their access. But lever-action shotguns with less than five rounds will remain far more easily accessible to shooters and will only be listed as category B.

      "bodyText": "The chairman of federal parliament\u2019s environment and energy committee has called for a serious discussion about whether a proportion of natural gas supply in Australia needs to be reserved for domestic use rather than sold overseas. The Nationals MP Andrew Broad told Guardian Australia\u2019s Politics Live podcast there needed to be consideration about whether 15% of gas supply should be reserved for Australian manufacturing rather than exported. Noting that his view differed from the position of federal Liberal party colleagues on the question, Broad said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a real discussion that has to be had about a reserve policy.\u201d He said there was already a reserve policy in Western Australia and that policy had worked. There now needed to be consideration at the national level about whether 15% should be reserved for Australian manufacturing \u201cto ensure we are best using those resources to lift Australians\u2019 wealth\u201d. \u201cI believe the wealth of Australia is the common wealth,\u201d he said. In WA, 15% of the gas produced by each liquefied natural gas project must be kept for domestic use. This week the WA premier, Colin Barnett, argued that the WA policy should apply at the national level. \u201cThe situation on the east coast is there is no reservation and indeed successive federal governments have argued against a reservation policy,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to say it\u2019s a failed position.\u201d The Australian Workers\u2019 Union, which has long championed a reserve policy, also this week wrote to the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, urging him to sit down with gas companies to renegotiate contracts. The AWU secretary, Daniel Walton, said allowing unchecked gas exports created bumper profits for \u201cforeign multinational gas companies\u201d but the behaviour had \u201cupended Australia\u2019s energy market\u201d. \u201cCheap gas has traditionally fuelled Australia\u2019s energy competitiveness and powered downstream manufacturing for decades,\u201d Walton said in the letter to Turnbull. \u201cGoing forward it should be providing abundant and cost-effective carbon reductions as Australia moves to a cleaner energy future.\u201d Broad\u2019s comments about a reservation policy came during a wide-ranging interview with Guardian Australia about a new inquiry he has established with Labor\u2019s Pat Conroy, the deputy chair of the parliamentary committee on environment and energy, to examine the policies required to modernise Australia\u2019s energy grid. The two MPs, who entered parliament together in the 2013 election and have parliamentary offices close to one another, have taken it upon themselves to try to carve out some territory of mutual agreement in an effort to get past the pitched partisan battle that has raged about power prices and energy security. Conroy, who is the shadow assistant minister for climate change and energy, said there was \u201creal merit\u201d in looking at a domestic reserve policy for gas but he said the major issue was price. \u201cAt the moment, Australian manufacturers are not paying export parity, they are paying above export parity,\u201d Conroy said. He said Australian manufacturers were paying more for gas than energy companies in Japan and South Korea \u201cand that means there\u2019s something wrong with the market\u201d. \u201cThis issue is not just reservation, it\u2019s pricing.\u201d Gas prices have soared, rising from $3 to $4 a gigajoule on average to about $6 or $7 \u2013 with periodic price spikes as high as $20. The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has thus far resisted calls for a domestic gas reserve. Frydenberg noted in early February the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Productivity Commission had argued a national gas reservation policy was unwise. He said the government was interested in \u201cinnovative ways\u201d of getting more supply into the domestic market to overcome the roadblocks created by state moratoria on coal seam gas exploration. A spokeswoman for the prime minister said the government was \u201copen to considering ideas that will improve gas supply\u201d but it was \u201cnot currently government policy to support gas reservation\u201d.",

I couldn\u2019t imagine not having a car. Not that I expect prisons to be well-located and designed with paying customers in mind, but Australians taxpayers have been footing the bill for prisons for quite some time. There\u2019s also a requirement through both legislation and policies that access for visitors should be suitable for maintaining and developing relationships with inmates.</p> <p>I\u2019m just a friend of an inmate, as well as a justice and health researcher and formerly health promotion service provider. I\u2019m not a partner or a child; I don\u2019t have an intertwined life with someone inside.

These were rare glimpses into the experiences and needs of prisoners, conducted for 20 years by Catholic Prison Ministry and also the Prisoners\u2019 Legal Service in Queensland. They found that few people received prison visits, that the application process and criteria to visit often excluded people if they had prior criminal charges or literacy problems, and that facilities were not conducive to bringing children.</p> <p>But in 2014 the door was shut on this type of research, with corrective services saying they already had \u201ca robust oversight framework in place to ensure an appropriate level of accountability and transparency\u201d.</p> <p>Prisoners are deliberately hidden; removal from the community is one of the aims of punishment. But the other rehabilitative aim seems minimised.

      "bodyText": "\u201cCome on, you mongrels, come on, let us in.\u201d Not usually what you\u2019d expect to hear standing at a prison gate. Unless you\u2019re there to visit, in which case you\u2019ve probably said something similar or maybe even worse. Out of the 10 or so prisons I\u2019ve visited or worked at in Queensland and New South Wales, only one has been straightforward to get to. I couldn\u2019t imagine not having a car. Not that I expect prisons to be well-located and designed with paying customers in mind, but Australians taxpayers have been footing the bill for prisons for quite some time. There\u2019s also a requirement through both legislation and policies that access for visitors should be suitable for maintaining and developing relationships with inmates. I\u2019m just a friend of an inmate, as well as a justice and health researcher and formerly health promotion service provider. I\u2019m not a partner or a child; I don\u2019t have an intertwined life with someone inside. But even for me, visiting isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019ve been part of research teams investigating parental incarceration impacts on family relationships, including one using interviews with prisoner advisory committees. These were rare glimpses into the experiences and needs of prisoners, conducted for 20 years by Catholic Prison Ministry and also the Prisoners\u2019 Legal Service in Queensland. They found that few people received prison visits, that the application process and criteria to visit often excluded people if they had prior criminal charges or literacy problems, and that facilities were not conducive to bringing children. But in 2014 the door was shut on this type of research, with corrective services saying they already had \u201ca robust oversight framework in place to ensure an appropriate level of accountability and transparency\u201d. Prisoners are deliberately hidden; removal from the community is one of the aims of punishment. But the other rehabilitative aim seems minimised. If governments have such accountability and responsibility, we must wonder why many prisoners return home worse off or end up back inside. That\u2019s part of the importance of the community visiting inmates. Visiting is a key strategy for governments to also meet their on-paper commitment to \u201cthroughcare\u201d \u2013 providing some continuity of care from prison and to community reintegration. But if communities are locked out, it\u2019s a one-sided response. With so much new technology, prisons could be much more strategically connected. The visiting systems have hardly changed in the two decades I\u2019ve been going. I only go occasionally, partly because it is hard. I always start worrying the day before, wondering: did I write the correct time down? Will the person be there? What if they have been moved, or are back in court? How can I cancel the visit in time if it turns out I can\u2019t make it? Imagine expecting someone and they don\u2019t show up. It must happen all the time. There\u2019s a limit on numbers who can visit but who\u2019d know what the figures are? I\u2019ve never seen any clear details published, despite this data being available (we give it when we go in).

You\u2019re waiting for the Festival with all your good horses.</p> <p>\u201cPeople look at the figure and they don\u2019t look at the fact. At the moment they\u2019re all fine, there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with any of the horses, and Blaklion wasn\u2019t too bad, was he [when second in the Grand National Trial at Haydock].\u201d</p> <p>Ballyandy, who took one of the season\u2019s most valuable prizes to date in the Betfair Hurdle last time out, landed the Champion Bumper at last year\u2019s meeting and is due to face a field that includes Moon Racer, the 2015 Champion Bumper winner, who beat him by nearly three lengths over the Supreme course and distance in November.</p> <p>\u201cHe cantered to the last in the Betfair and then quickened away nicely,\u201d Twiston-Davies said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always thought an awful lot of him and I can\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t do better in his first three races, but he managed to handicap himself nicely and let\u2019s go on to better things now.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got plenty of speed and he won there this time last year, over two miles but with no hurdles. We\u2019re really looking forward to it and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to take our revenge on Moon Racer.</p> <p>\u201cI think Foxtail Hill is our best chance. It\u2019s just the way the race turns out, it\u2019s a very compressed handicap with 3lb or 4lb between the whole lot of them. He\u2019s nearly a [Grade One] JLT horse, but why go for that when you\u2019ve got that lower-class race?\u201d</p> <p>Imperial Commander went under the radar in 2010 when the attention of most punters was focused on Kauto Star and Denman, and Twiston-Davies feels the same could be true of Bristol De Mai in this year\u2019s Gold Cup following a disappointing run last time out.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand it with Imperial Commander but I can understand it with him because it wasn\u2019t a great run at Newbury,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cHe was very good at Haydock [when winning the Peter Marsh Chase] and we can put a line through Newbury, he just wasn\u2019t himself that day. When he got back he was very lame and had a whole week of not being right.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s come right now and if he can stay sound, I\u2019m very hopeful. He\u2019s very much a horse who goes his own pace, he\u2019ll be right up there in the front line but he\u2019s settling a lot better now. He stays, he jumps, he\u2019s uncomplicated.\u201d</p> <p>Even a second victory in the Gold Cup might not be the highlight of Twiston-Davies\u2019s Festival if The New One, the Neptune Novice Hurdle winner in 2013, could take the Champion Hurdle at the fourth attempt.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be wonderful, that would be the highlight of everything,\u201d Twiston-Davies said. \u201cHe\u2019s been so brilliant for us over the years, it\u2019s time it happened for him really.</p> <p>\u201cHe was desperately unlucky in his first one, he was definitely knocked back [by a faller] further than he was beaten. Hopefully this will be the year when everything falls right for him.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re happier with him than we have been for a long time. He\u2019s had soundness issues in the past, but this year since October he hasn\u2019t had an unsound step.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think his age makes any difference, he didn\u2019t seem to be showing it when he won the International Hurdle at Cheltenham [in December]. He never seems to sparkle at Haydock but he keeps winning there, and back at his favourite course, he\u2019ll be flying up the hill.\u201d</p> <h2>Thursday\u2019s tips by Chris Cook</h2> <p><strong>Doncaster</strong> 1.50 Recognition 2.20 Wenyerreadyfreddie 2.50 Banny\u2019s Lad 3.25 Lady Buttons 4.00 Copper Kay 4.30 Apterix 5.05 The Wise One</p> <p><strong>Lingfield</strong> 2.00 Simply Me 2.30 Havelock 3.05 Black Dave 3.40 Horsted Keynes 4.10 Dark Destroyer 4.45 Ulysses</p> <p><strong>Newbury</strong> 2.10 Quids In 2.40 Le Breuil 3.15 Plaisir D\u2019Amour (nap) 3.50 Beggars Cross 4.20 Quarenta 4.55 Souriyan (nb) 5.25 Reine Des Miracles</p> <p><strong>Newcastle</strong> 5.15 Persun 5.45 Fiendish 6.15 Poet\u2019s Reward 6.45 Bastia 7.15 Gowanless 7.45 Dose</p>",

In terms of number of winners and prize money earned, this is already certain to be Twiston-Davies\u2019s best season since at least 2010, and a good Cheltenham could make it the best of his career, even before Blaklion heads to Aintree as a leading candidate for the Grand National. It is rare for a trainer to seem confident about a runner in a Festival handicap, but from a team that includes Ballyandy, a possible favourite for the Supreme Hurdle, and Wholestone, third-favourite for the Albert Bartlett, Twiston-Davies feels that Foxtail Hill, the 10-1 joint-favourite for the Close Brothers Novice Handicap Chase, could be his best chance of the meeting, with Ballyandy not far behind.

At the moment they\u2019re all fine, there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with any of the horses, and Blaklion wasn\u2019t too bad, was he [when second in the Grand National Trial at Haydock].\u201d Ballyandy, who took one of the season\u2019s most valuable prizes to date in the Betfair Hurdle last time out, landed the Champion Bumper at last year\u2019s meeting and is due to face a field that includes Moon Racer, the 2015 Champion Bumper winner, who beat him by nearly three lengths over the Supreme course and distance in November. \u201cHe cantered to the last in the Betfair and then quickened away nicely,\u201d Twiston-Davies said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always thought an awful lot of him and I can\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t do better in his first three races, but he managed to handicap himself nicely and let\u2019s go on to better things now. \u201cHe\u2019s got plenty of speed and he won there this time last year, over two miles but with no hurdles. We\u2019re really looking forward to it and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to take our revenge on Moon Racer. \u201cI think Foxtail Hill is our best chance. It\u2019s just the way the race turns out, it\u2019s a very compressed handicap with 3lb or 4lb between the whole lot of them. He\u2019s nearly a [Grade One] JLT horse, but why go for that when you\u2019ve got that lower-class race?\u201d Imperial Commander went under the radar in 2010 when the attention of most punters was focused on Kauto Star and Denman, and Twiston-Davies feels the same could be true of Bristol De Mai in this year\u2019s Gold Cup following a disappointing run last time out. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand it with Imperial Commander but I can understand it with him because it wasn\u2019t a great run at Newbury,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cHe was very good at Haydock [when winning the Peter Marsh Chase] and we can put a line through Newbury, he just wasn\u2019t himself that day. When he got back he was very lame and had a whole week of not being right. \u201cHe\u2019s come right now and if he can stay sound, I\u2019m very hopeful. He\u2019s very much a horse who goes his own pace, he\u2019ll be right up there in the front line but he\u2019s settling a lot better now. He stays, he jumps, he\u2019s uncomplicated.\u201d Even a second victory in the Gold Cup might not be the highlight of Twiston-Davies\u2019s Festival if The New One, the Neptune Novice Hurdle winner in 2013, could take the Champion Hurdle at the fourth attempt. \u201cIt would be wonderful, that would be the highlight of everything,\u201d Twiston-Davies said. \u201cHe\u2019s been so brilliant for us over the years, it\u2019s time it happened for him really. \u201cHe was desperately unlucky in his first one, he was definitely knocked back [by a faller] further than he was beaten. Hopefully this will be the year when everything falls right for him. \u201cWe\u2019re happier with him than we have been for a long time. He\u2019s had soundness issues in the past, but this year since October he hasn\u2019t had an unsound step. \u201cI don\u2019t think his age makes any difference, he didn\u2019t seem to be showing it when he won the International Hurdle at Cheltenham [in December]. He never seems to sparkle at Haydock but he keeps winning there, and back at his favourite course, he\u2019ll be flying up the hill.\u201d Thursday\u2019s tips by Chris Cook Doncaster 1.50 Recognition 2.20 Wenyerreadyfreddie 2.50 Banny\u2019s Lad 3.25 Lady Buttons 4.00 Copper Kay 4.30 Apterix 5.05 The Wise One Lingfield 2.00 Simply Me 2.30 Havelock 3.05 Black Dave 3.40 Horsted Keynes 4.10 Dark Destroyer 4.45 Ulysses Newbury 2.10 Quids In 2.40 Le Breuil 3.15 Plaisir D\u2019Amour (nap) 3.50 Beggars Cross 4.20 Quarenta 4.55 Souriyan (nb) 5.25 Reine Des Miracles Newcastle 5.15 Persun 5.45 Fiendish 6.15 Poet\u2019s Reward 6.45 Bastia 7.15 Gowanless 7.45 Dose",

Whomever dominates, wins.</p> <h2><strong>The role</strong></h2> <p>Confined to their side\u2019s defensive third and pitted against the opposition\u2019s most accurate and prolific scorer, keepers, as in the world game, have the seemingly uncomplicated task of stopping goals.</p> <p>Keepers work in close partnership with the goal defence, who marks the goal attack, to push both shooters as far as possible from the post, making scoring difficult. They defend shots on goal, take throw-ins and penalties in the third and make attacking moves to drive the ball to the transverse line. They\u2019re also often the \u201cvoice\u201d of a team, as they can see the entire court and have less \u201con\u201d time than other players.</p> <p>They must have a borderline obsessive focus on one-on-one defence of the generally tall goal shooter, putting pressure on their body and their shots, whilst also pulling in rebounds.

You\u2019ve got to be annoying and have a bit of mongrel. Not like the lip-stick-wearing girls who shoot.\u201d</p> <p>Physically, height is an advantage, but not vital, 183cm Ellis says. \u201cI was never the tallest and I\u2019d argue good footwork is more important. It\u2019s footwork that gets you to the ball, footwork that gets you out of trouble and footwork that puts doubt in the throwers\u2019 mind, which create turnovers.\u201d Core strength, good elevation, speed off the mark and impeccable timing are other key weapons in a keeper\u2019s arsenal.</p> <p>Current Diamonds keeper and captain, Sharni Layton, who has also played wing defence and goal defence in her elite career, says keepers need to do the basics \u201cextremely well\u201d, be persistent and have a strong game sense. \u201cIn lots of ways, you\u2019re playing a game of chess with your opponent, so it\u2019s a mental game as well as physical,\u201d Layton says.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to work around the body and think about how to confuse the thrower. You need to constantly be on the move, using great footwork, but not \u2018over move\u2019 and I always want to be able to see the ball, my player and my goal defence. That\u2019s a lot to think about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"882d2010085eb91fd6c1d0202c18b5e09eaf3eab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/882d2010085eb91fd6c1d0202c18b5e09eaf3eab/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Magpies goal keeper Sharni Layton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Magpies goal keeper Sharni Layton competes for the ball with Romelda Aiken of the Firebirds during round two of Super Netball.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Hyde/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Lean, jump or baulk?</strong></h2> <p>While some coaches at grassroots level insist defenders always \u201chang\u201d on a shot, rather than attempt a timed jump to affect a basketball-style rejection or baulk to put shooters off their rhythm, Ellis and Layton agree it\u2019s situational.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a minute-by-minute proposition,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cEvery player is different. You know you can put some off with a particular approach, some hate when you lean, so you stay on the lean, while others dislike when you go into a crouch and are scared waiting for you to jump. You have to read the game and work out what\u2019s best in any given situation. A good goal keeper can think their way through a game.\u201d</p> <p>Layton says the past is often a good predictor of the future, but variety still reigns. \u201cIf I know what\u2019s worked previously on a player, I\u2019ll stick with that, but it\u2019s all trial and error,\u201d the 188cm Melbourne native, says. \u201cIf something is working, you keep doing that, if it\u2019s not, you have to be able to mix it up with a lean, a jump, even a windmill.\u201d Layton works on being able to hold a lean for at least five seconds \u2013 just like her childhood hero, Ellis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/16/the-guardians-guide-to-playing-netball-part-five-goal-attack\">The Guardian\u2019s guide to playing netball \u2013 part five: goal attack</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Communication is key</strong></h2> <p>The value of \u201cgetting on the same page with your goal defence\u201d can\u2019t be over-stated, Layton says. \u201cThat partnership is so key. You need to speak the same language. You need to understand each other\u2019s calls. When you call \u2018base\u2019 does that mean you want them to go to the base line or you are going base? Communication is the key to not leaving your mate high and dry.\u201d </p> <p>Layton is forming a formidable partnership with Collingwood team mate April Brandley at both international and domestic level.</p> <h2><strong>The unseen work</strong></h2> <p>Keepers often work \u201clong and hard with little reward\u201d, but when it comes it really matters, Ellis says. \u201cA lot of what a keeper does in a match, people don\u2019t necessarily see. The hassling, the footwork, the near-tips, working the ground, stepping up to your player. That might all pay zero dividends in the first half of a match. You might not get a single intercept.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you wear shooters down, players get tired, passes start missing and then the intercepts often come in the last quarter. That\u2019s what good goal keepers do.\u201d</p>",

Key attributes The former Diamonds captain turned commentator, Liz Ellis, who played 122 Tests, mostly at keeper, tells Guardian Australia the key temperamental attributes for the position include intelligence, resilience, determination and \u201ca bit of mongrel.\u201d Only the supremely intelligent can play the position, she laughs. \u201cMy gut feeling is that keepers probably have more university degrees, per capita, than any other position.\u201d IQ aside, keepers \u201cneed plenty of resilience, because you end up as the patsy quite a bit,\u201d Ellis says, referring to balls sailing over keepers\u2019 heads or being left exposed by poor pressure out the front. \u201cYou need to be determined, prepared to go hard all day and wear someone down, to make someone\u2019s life difficult. You\u2019ve got to be annoying and have a bit of mongrel. Not like the lip-stick-wearing girls who shoot.\u201d Physically, height is an advantage, but not vital, 183cm Ellis says. \u201cI was never the tallest and I\u2019d argue good footwork is more important. It\u2019s footwork that gets you to the ball, footwork that gets you out of trouble and footwork that puts doubt in the throwers\u2019 mind, which create turnovers.\u201d Core strength, good elevation, speed off the mark and impeccable timing are other key weapons in a keeper\u2019s arsenal. Current Diamonds keeper and captain, Sharni Layton, who has also played wing defence and goal defence in her elite career, says keepers need to do the basics \u201cextremely well\u201d, be persistent and have a strong game sense. \u201cIn lots of ways, you\u2019re playing a game of chess with your opponent, so it\u2019s a mental game as well as physical,\u201d Layton says. \u201cYou need to work around the body and think about how to confuse the thrower. You need to constantly be on the move, using great footwork, but not \u2018over move\u2019 and I always want to be able to see the ball, my player and my goal defence. That\u2019s a lot to think about.\u201d Lean, jump or baulk? While some coaches at grassroots level insist defenders always \u201chang\u201d on a shot, rather than attempt a timed jump to affect a basketball-style rejection or baulk to put shooters off their rhythm, Ellis and Layton agree it\u2019s situational. \u201cIt\u2019s a minute-by-minute proposition,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cEvery player is different. You know you can put some off with a particular approach, some hate when you lean, so you stay on the lean, while others dislike when you go into a crouch and are scared waiting for you to jump. You have to read the game and work out what\u2019s best in any given situation. A good goal keeper can think their way through a game.\u201d Layton says the past is often a good predictor of the future, but variety still reigns. \u201cIf I know what\u2019s worked previously on a player, I\u2019ll stick with that, but it\u2019s all trial and error,\u201d the 188cm Melbourne native, says. \u201cIf something is working, you keep doing that, if it\u2019s not, you have to be able to mix it up with a lean, a jump, even a windmill.\u201d Layton works on being able to hold a lean for at least five seconds \u2013 just like her childhood hero, Ellis. Communication is key The value of \u201cgetting on the same page with your goal defence\u201d can\u2019t be over-stated, Layton says. \u201cThat partnership is so key. You need to speak the same language. You need to understand each other\u2019s calls. When you call \u2018base\u2019 does that mean you want them to go to the base line or you are going base? Communication is the key to not leaving your mate high and dry.\u201d Layton is forming a formidable partnership with Collingwood team mate April Brandley at both international and domestic level. The unseen work Keepers often work \u201clong and hard with little reward\u201d, but when it comes it really matters, Ellis says. \u201cA lot of what a keeper does in a match, people don\u2019t necessarily see. The hassling, the footwork, the near-tips, working the ground, stepping up to your player. That might all pay zero dividends in the first half of a match. You might not get a single intercept.\u201d \u201cBut you wear shooters down, players get tired, passes start missing and then the intercepts often come in the last quarter. That\u2019s what good goal keepers do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When Amy Beach (1867-1944) was a child in New England, her mother banned her from playing the piano in public until she turned 16. Strict Calvinism didn\u2019t smile on girl prodigies. When she married at 18, her husband allowed her a concert per year, so instead she composed. Her Piano Concerto has the heft and torrent of music that needs to be written and Danny Driver plays it with clarity and steel, absolutely unsentimental but flecked through with empathy. The second movement might have revealed some more delicate orchestral shimmer \u2013 it sounds here like a chastely buttoned Ravel \u2013 but the sturdy weft Rebecca Miller gets from the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra generally suits Beach\u2019s broad-stitch writing. This release (volume 70 of Hyperion\u2019s whopping Romantic Piano Concerto series) is timed for International Women\u2019s Day on 8 March and also includes Dorothy Howell\u2019s D Minor Concerto, a gracious throwback written in 1923, and the concertstuck by C\u00e9cile Chaminade. Ambroise Thomas liked her music: \u201cThis is not a woman who composes,\u201d he declared, \u201cbut a composer who is a woman.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Cuadrilla, a leading fracking company, has complained at what he calls intimidation and harassment by \u201cirresponsible\u201d activists protesting at a shale gas site the firm is constructing in Lancashire. The CEO, Francis Egan, said he felt the balance between the right to protest and the right for companies to go about their business had tipped in the wrong direction. Work began in January on the company\u2019s Preston New Road site, in Little Plumpton, Fylde West. It will be the location of the UK\u2019s first horizontally fracked wells. Each day, 10 to 20 people have protested outside the site\u2019s fence. The majority were peaceful, and most of the aggressive protest was people shouting through the fence, Egan said. However, Cuadrilla said one worker leaving the site had the windscreen of his van smashed by an activist wielding a chain. The employee had refused to go back to the site. \u201cThere\u2019s verbal abuse,\u201d said Egan, about the protesters. \u201cThey swear at people. One guy [a Cuadrilla worker] had a death threat which he reported to police. You don\u2019t think someone\u2019s going to follow it through, but it\u2019s indicative of how strongly they\u2019re feeling. They shout things like \u2018you mustn\u2019t have children because you wouldn\u2019t do this if you had children\u2019, \u2018how can you live with yourself\u2019.\u201d Two suppliers subcontracted to supply material for the site, one for stones and one for cement, have ended their relationship with Cuadrilla\u2019s civil engineering contractor after protesters blockaded their businesses. \u201cIn view of the drastic effect this is now having on the rest of my customers we have no alternative but to cease supplies to the above site [Preston New Road],\u201d the cement company, Moore Readymix, wrote in an email to A E Yates, the company contracted to do the site works. Egan said of the protests and pressure on suppliers: \u201cI think it is irresponsible because people have a right to go about their day to day work. Your right to protest shouldn\u2019t be allowed to supersede some business\u2019s right to do business with us.\u201d Cuadrilla also said that activists wearing hi-viz jackets were stopping and waving over lorries on the A-road by the site and asking the drivers where they were going. Lancashire police said there had been about 30 arrests relating to incidents near the Cuadrilla site since the start of January, for a variety of offences, including obstructing the highway. Anti-fracking activists this week vowed to continue persuading Cuadrilla\u2019s suppliers to drop contracts, starting with a series of direct actions from 27 March. Ash Hewitson, of the group Reclaim the Power, said: \u201cBy taking out the links in the chain we can break the whole industry into pieces.\u201d Egan questioned whether it was right that the firm should be threatened in such a way. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything illegal, immoral. I believe we\u2019re doing something useful. You may have a different view. Fine, express it, write to your MP, come and shout \u2013 we\u2019ve provided a protest area. You can scream, shout, wave banners, but don\u2019t try and stop someone doing business with us.\u201d Campaigners said the company was trying to depict them unfairly, and complained at what they said was a disproportionately large police presence. Barbara Richardson, a retired teaching assistant who lives at the nearby village of Roseacre, said she had been outside the site most days since the work began. Protests had been peaceful and relations cordial with the police, she said. \u201cCuadrilla are out to exaggerate and make protesters out to be far more aggressive than they are,\u201d she said. Richardson said the policing had become more heavy handed after anti-fracking activists locked themselves together in January and February. \u201cYesterday there were six police vans, and every time a van came [to and from the site], 50 officers came out to surround them.\u201d On Wednesday, local police apologised for how they had characterised an anti-fracking rally last weekend. Another fracking company was embroiled this week in a war of words with protesters. John Dewar, director of operations at Third Energy, which is fracking a well in Kirby Misperton, North Yorkshire, said to activists: \u201cPlease go away. We respect their right to protest but they should respect our right to operate.\u201d Robert Laycock, a resident in the district, said in response: \u201cOur holiday cottage business, Flamingoland, Castle Howard and all the other tourist businesses in this area, will all be affected by that [fracking]. He says \u2018please go away\u2019 \u2013 we are not going to go away, we live here.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Polish composer/violinist Gra\u017cyna Bacewicz summed up her music as \u201caggressive and at the same time lyrical\u201d. She was right \u2013 try the 1949 Quartet for Four Violins, with its fearless dashes from bruising dance to sparse elegy and back again. The piece is tactile and gritty; it was meant for teaching, but never in a dry way. A handful of decent recordings in recent years have bolstered an interest in Bacewicz\u2019s feisty compositions, and this disc led by pianist Diana Ambache fills in more chamber music gaps. There\u2019s the eerie Trio for Oboe, Harp and Percussion and the brilliantly dense, scurrying Quartet for Four Cellos. All the other works in the programme (folk dances, a theme and variations) show evidence of what a spirited violinist Bacewicz herself was. The sound of the recording has a homemade grain to it but the playing is top-notch, with violin duties shared out between David Juritz, Victoria Sayles, Richard Milone and Charlotte Scott, and Ambache unshakeable at the piano.",

That\u2019s not good enough</a>, 2 March). What the party needs is not a new leader but a clear and coherent political philosophy.</p> <p>Electing an unequivocally socialist leader, whose approach is inclusive and unaggressive, should have called into question much of what the party appeared to stand for, but we are still waiting for the galvanising statement of\u00a0socialism for the 21st century. Voters may not care much about philosophy, and the British electorate is notoriously anti-intellectual, but everybody needs to know what it means to vote for a party \u2013 and how, in broad terms, that party can shape society for a new future.</p> <p>It is not realistic to think that the mechanics of policy-making will be enough to compensate for an inadequate vision of the future. It is also unrealistic to blame Corbyn for this situation. It is probably fair to say that he needed to be tougher with the recalcitrant New Labour wing of the PLP, but only after the second leadership election \u2013 and, by then, the entire political situation had been compromised by the referendum.</p> <p>Jones has always given the impression that he would be an ideal person to help shape Labour\u2019s vision, but he is showing signs of impatience. This is not good, and certainly not necessary. Labour can take its time \u2013 in spite of the speed with which the political map can change. The important thing is to have something people can believe in, something that can survive success and failure. Perhaps the building and shaping process has been started but it needs to be more visible, and it needs help. Get\u00a0back on board, Owen!<br /><strong>Michael Bowers</strong><br /><em>Talgarth, Breconshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is right. While the origins\u00a0of Labour\u2019s troubles are longstanding, there is no evidence that the leadership elections of 2015 and 2016 have turned the tide.</p> <p>Labour has appeared paralysed in the face of a resurgent \u201cnasty party\u201d, without a coherent response to Brexit or the continued attrition of public services.

      "bodyText": "Owen Jones has misunderstood Labour\u2019s problems (Jeremy Corbyn says he\u2019s staying on as leader. That\u2019s not good enough, 2 March). What the party needs is not a new leader but a clear and coherent political philosophy. Electing an unequivocally socialist leader, whose approach is inclusive and unaggressive, should have called into question much of what the party appeared to stand for, but we are still waiting for the galvanising statement of&nbsp;socialism for the 21st century. Voters may not care much about philosophy, and the British electorate is notoriously anti-intellectual, but everybody needs to know what it means to vote for a party \u2013 and how, in broad terms, that party can shape society for a new future. It is not realistic to think that the mechanics of policy-making will be enough to compensate for an inadequate vision of the future. It is also unrealistic to blame Corbyn for this situation. It is probably fair to say that he needed to be tougher with the recalcitrant New Labour wing of the PLP, but only after the second leadership election \u2013 and, by then, the entire political situation had been compromised by the referendum. Jones has always given the impression that he would be an ideal person to help shape Labour\u2019s vision, but he is showing signs of impatience. This is not good, and certainly not necessary. Labour can take its time \u2013 in spite of the speed with which the political map can change. The important thing is to have something people can believe in, something that can survive success and failure. Perhaps the building and shaping process has been started but it needs to be more visible, and it needs help. Get&nbsp;back on board, Owen! Michael Bowers Talgarth, Breconshire \u2022 Owen Jones is right. While the origins&nbsp;of Labour\u2019s troubles are longstanding, there is no evidence that the leadership elections of 2015 and 2016 have turned the tide. Labour has appeared paralysed in the face of a resurgent \u201cnasty party\u201d, without a coherent response to Brexit or the continued attrition of public services. Corbyn\u2019s 10-point programme for Britain\u2019s future, set out last August, could have formed the basis for a set of popular policies capable of regaining the trust of the electorate, but these have not been developed or articulated. In this media-driven age, it is essential that party leaders are able to communicate their ideas clearly to reach out beyond their committed supporters to the wider public. Both personal and external factors have prevented Corbyn from transcending his role as a catalyst for a much needed change of party direction.

Those who oppose the definition are simply blind to Jew-hatred. When the academics who wrote to you (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/27/university-wrong-to-ban-israeli-apartheid-week-event\" title=\"\">28 February</a>) read the definition, they will have seen that it says that \u201ccriticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic\u201d. They claim that all they want to do is rationally criticise Israel and they fear that we will call them antisemites. That would be conflation of antisemitism with criticism of Israel and under this definition they have nothing to fear.</p> <p>What the definition does consider to be antisemitic is calling Jews or the Jewish state the successor to the Nazis. That is not criticism, it is hate speech. The definition equally calls those who engage in spreading conspiracy myths about Jewish subterfuge and nefarious power antisemites, and of course the definition is right. It is no wonder that we have asked students to gather evidence of antisemitism and send it to us so that we can take it up with universities. Today, everybody carries in their pockets a high-definition video camera and so Jewish students are thankfully able to prove that they are being intimidated and abused, and we are able to help them. The particular brand of antisemitism that disguises itself as discourse about Israel is finally becoming political, social\u00a0and professional suicide.\u00a0</p> <p>This recognition of the full spectrum of antisemitism comes not a moment too soon: on campuses where \u201coppression\u201d is so frequently discussed, Jewish students are being squeezed out of student life. The international definition of antisemitism has been endorsed by 31 nations now, not out of fealty to Israel, but out of recognition that antisemitism rots society from within, and that Jews are sadly, as ever, on the front line.<br /><strong>Gideon Falter</strong><br /><em>Chairman, Campaign Against Antisemitism</em></p> <p><strong>\u2022<em> Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong>\u2022<em> Read more Guardian letters \u2013 </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>click here to visit gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The international definition of antisemitism adopted by the prime minister following a long campaign does not conflate antisemitism and criticism of Israel. Those who oppose the definition are simply blind to Jew-hatred. When the academics who wrote to you (28 February) read the definition, they will have seen that it says that \u201ccriticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic\u201d. They claim that all they want to do is rationally criticise Israel and they fear that we will call them antisemites. That would be conflation of antisemitism with criticism of Israel and under this definition they have nothing to fear. What the definition does consider to be antisemitic is calling Jews or the Jewish state the successor to the Nazis. That is not criticism, it is hate speech. The definition equally calls those who engage in spreading conspiracy myths about Jewish subterfuge and nefarious power antisemites, and of course the definition is right. It is no wonder that we have asked students to gather evidence of antisemitism and send it to us so that we can take it up with universities. Today, everybody carries in their pockets a high-definition video camera and so Jewish students are thankfully able to prove that they are being intimidated and abused, and we are able to help them. The particular brand of antisemitism that disguises itself as discourse about Israel is finally becoming political, social&nbsp;and professional suicide.&nbsp; This recognition of the full spectrum of antisemitism comes not a moment too soon: on campuses where \u201coppression\u201d is so frequently discussed, Jewish students are being squeezed out of student life. The international definition of antisemitism has been endorsed by 31 nations now, not out of fealty to Israel, but out of recognition that antisemitism rots society from within, and that Jews are sadly, as ever, on the front line.

Sitting with him after training, however, he is charming, thoughtful and engaging.</p> <p>Swaggering out of the changing rooms and into the boiling Brazilian sunshine for a couple of hours\u2019 training, he greets everyone warmly, kisses the team\u2019s press officer good morning as he passes, speaking Portuguese almost without an accent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec7d7c992a7b1f94a97195c3cc3e99852df59b1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec7d7c992a7b1f94a97195c3cc3e99852df59b1d/0_0_4756_2853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kazim-Richards now finds himself at a struggling club trying to rebuild.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kazim-Richards now finds himself at a struggling club trying to rebuild.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Martinho for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first thing you notice is the size of the man. He is easily the biggest player in the squad, the dark blue Corinthians training top clinging tightly to him whereas it rather hangs off some of the others. He is built more like a rugby player these days and looks like an action hero.</p> <p>There is more to Kazim-Richards than just muscles, though. In fact, there seem to be two Colin Kazim-Richards\u2019s. First there is the warrior we see on the pitch. \u201cI\u2019m \u2018ride or die\u2019 for my team whoever or wherever they are. If you\u2019re messing with my guy on the pitch, I\u2019m taking charge of that. If you\u2019re trying to bully someone, I\u2019m taking charge of that. What needs to be said to the coach, OK, I\u2019ll say it. And that\u2019s been my downfall. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re a general, innit, hahaha.\u201d</p> <p>Then there is the man we do not see too often: the worrier. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep after games. I go over and over everything. I could fall asleep at 7am and then wake up at 8am with my kids.\u201d This is a man who sees what is going on around him and quietly offers help; someone who always has food and water in his car to give to those less fortunate. In Brazil, there is no escaping the poverty. \u201cSometimes it makes you upset, like it makes you feel selfish: \u2018Should I really be enjoying my day?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I respect England. They didn't give my mum and dad anything but they gave us \u2026 a platform</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To try to fully understand this \u201cone-off\u201d player and his unorthodox trajectory, however, we need to go right back to the start. His Turkish-Cypriot, Muslim mother was evacuated from the Mediterranean island by the British army after a military coup in 1974. His father is a Rastafarian, born to Antiguan Christian parents, and used to get attacked just for stepping out with her. \u201cI\u2019d say from round about 1983 you start seeing mixed-race babies [in London]. It wasn\u2019t the norm. So my mum and dad had all that. My dad, especially, had skinheads beating him up, going to wars with them in Walthamstow.\u201d</p> <p>Kaz, as he is known to his friends back home, is as London as they come but has always felt Turkish, attended Turkish school as a child and spoke the language at home with his mum and \u201cnene\u201d (grandma).</p> <p>Asked whether he feels English at all, Kazim-Richards hesitates before giving his answer, knowing full well that his responses can, and do, get taken the wrong way. He confirms that he never had dreams of playing for England and if he does have roots anywhere, they\u2019re not in his country of birth.</p> <p>\u201cMy blood is not English, if you know what I\u2019m saying? Growing up it was Caribbean in my house and it was Turkish. I never ate fish and chips growing up, my mum cooked Turkish food and West Indian food. For a family, we\u2019re so far away from [being] English.</p> <p>\u201cI respect England. They didn\u2019t give my mum and dad anything but they gave us \u2026 a platform. And then it was down to my mum and dad and all our families to be able to try and make something out of it. Which 95% of us have failed to do. I\u2019m lucky, my dad and my mum had more perseverance with me and I was able to make something of my life but a lot of my cousins and a lot of friends are in jail or\u00a0dead.\u201d</p> <p>After being rejected by Arsenal, Kazim-Richards made what he says was the most difficult move of his life. \u201cI\u2019m from London and I moved to Bury \u2013 that\u2019s been the hardest move ever, culturally. There were no black people up there and food was hard for me. All that rolled into one. And then you go into training and people think it\u2019s funny to put bananas on your peg and then people think it\u2019s funny to cut up your shoes but what people don\u2019t realise is my dad don\u2019t have money.</p> <p>\u201cI was on \u00a345 a week \u2013 I can\u2019t buy new shoes every week. Cutting up your laces and putting a hole in your crotch on your trousers and shit like that. They don\u2019t understand how hard my dad works \u2026 I used to clean my trainers with a toothbrush.\u201d</p> <p>Would he describe that as \u201cfootball banter\u201d or racism? \u201cThe first time I think it\u2019s more ignorance, but then it really is racism after that, because they\u2019re not listening, they still think it\u2019s funny. And then you retaliate and you get labelled a bad boy,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He has had to deal with racism all his life and appeared in court after making a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/09/colin-kazim-richards-guilty-homophobic-gesture-brighton-fans\" title=\"\">\u201chomophobic\u201d gesture</a> towards Brighton fans in 2013. He does not regret it. \u201cI\u2019ve got more racism in England for being Turkish than being black. That \u2018homophobic\u2019 thing all started from people calling me a Turkish kebab. \u2018Go back to Turkey, you fucking Turkish kebab!\u2019 People have quoted that I\u2019ve got charged with homophobia but I didn\u2019t, I got charged with public disorder.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If someone else did it with a different name, different colour skin, they'd be like: 'Look! England's not the only way'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kazim-Richards does not see any difference between what he did and what the Brighton fans were doing to him and he feels the colour of his skin has made it easier for people to label him a bad boy. \u201cI think if I was a different colour, my career would be held up as an example rather than \u2018ah, he\u2019s a journeyman\u2019, because I don\u2019t suit the label.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve played for some of the biggest teams in the world, I\u2019m here now playing for one of the biggest teams in the world. And I just think if someone else did it, with a different name, different colour skin, they\u2019d be, like: \u2018Look, you see! England\u2019s not the only way.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Kazim-Richards feels a lot of players are judged differently because of their race and because of where they come from. \u201cLook at Raheem [Sterling] and [Paul] Pogba, for example, when they don\u2019t have a good game everybody comes down on them for like, crazy stuff. Crazy stuff. And then you look at other players\u00a0\u2026\u201d He trails off, letting the silence hang in the air. \u201cEveryone\u2019s quiet. I\u2019m not gonna say the names. Nobody has the same talks. Like I see a piece in the paper about Raheem in the pound shop and people are taking the piss like: \u2018Woah! He\u2019s earning this amount.\u2019 What? He can\u2019t shop at the pound shop?\u201d</p> <p>In Turkey he says he never had a problem being accepted \u201cbecause they saw it as I picked Turkey over England. Which I did at that time.\u201d Pulling on the national colours of Turkey are his fondest on-pitch memories to date. His voice softens. \u201cWhen I played for the national team the people loved me, bro. <em>Loved me.</em> And that\u2019s one thing that I love about it \u2013 it\u2019s a different kind of love. It makes you cry, playing for a nation like that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa74b2b0d27c96b7f0a32baf5dc1e87cb74da82f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa74b2b0d27c96b7f0a32baf5dc1e87cb74da82f/0_90_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kazim-Richards scores for Blackburn Rovers against his boyhood club, Arsenal, February 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kazim-Richards scores for Blackburn Rovers against his boyhood club, Arsenal, February 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerim Okten/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More outspoken on political issues than most players on his Twitter feed, he often posts messages about what is happening in Turkey. Last year, after scoring the decider for Coritiba in a local derby, he screamed, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/colinkazim?lang=en\" title=\"\">\u201cFuck terrorism! I love Turkey!\u201d down the camera lens and posted the video on Twitter with the message \u2018together we are stronger\u2019</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThese are kids that are getting blown up,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Turkey you don\u2019t have a choice about joining the military; my cousins have done it. My friend\u2019s dad got blown up on the bus. Umut Bulut, I played with him at Galatasaray and the national team \u2026 His dad got blown up in Ankara on the bus. And he\u2019s one of the nicest guys I\u2019ve ever met. That shit is painful.\u201d</p> <p>A product of the English system, Kazim-Richards now occupies a place well outside it, having returned only once in the past 10 years for a season\u2019s loan at Blackburn. Why don\u2019t more English players travel then? \u201cThey\u2019re comfy. It\u2019s not portrayed in the media, \u2018You can do this, you can go there\u2019. Everything is England, England, England. I\u2019ve seen guys that got released from Manchester United and rather than even going down to London to a League One or Championship side they\u2019re staying in Manchester playing amateur\u00a0football.\u201d</p> <p>He complains that English football is too closed and suffers from \u201cnepotism, jobs for the boys, prejudice and the belief that only those in control are correct\u201d. Kazim-Richards believes that the system is not built for guys such as him to succeed. \u201cIf you look like me and beg to differ you are ostracised.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We'll always have a home here, one million per cent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To try to address this perceived imbalance, he now invests heavily in a youth team, Kazim Richards Academy, in London. He likes to be there, when he can, to offer advice and guidance, something he said he missed growing up. \u201cWhen I go and talk to the kids, I tell them, you can do anything you wanna do wherever you wanna do it.\u201d</p> <p>Even in football, one of the great levellers, Kazim-Richards feels that diversity is discouraged. \u201cIn England the last thing they judge you on is your football ability and the first thing they judge you on is: \u2018Look what he\u2019s got on today, look at that line in his hair.\u2019 Bro, that\u2019s where I\u2019m from, you see?\u201d</p> <p>He now finds himself at a struggling team, trying to rebuild itself, and is getting used to the topsy-turvy world of Brazilian football. Corinthians were Brazilian champions in 2015 but then lost their manager, Tite, to the national squad and have not been the same since. Fans and staff at the club have clearly warmed to him and he has been given the moniker of \u201cGringo da favela\u201d. Corinthians are known in S\u00e3o Paulo as the team of the marginalised. Enter any favela in the city and Corinthians shirts easily outnumber those of their local rivals, S\u00e3o Paulo, Palmeiras and Santos. \u201cI tried to explain to them that, OK, I\u2019m not from your favela, we don\u2019t have favelas, but I\u2019m from an area that has the same injustices and the same kind of politics.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4e023dfc8c6fc607caab9f332959aac8910da21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4e023dfc8c6fc607caab9f332959aac8910da21/0_210_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A lot of teams get tired of that and I can see that Corinthians won\u2019t \u2013 they like that \u2013 so it\u2019s kind of like I\u2019ve found my home.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A lot of teams get tired of that and I can see that Corinthians won\u2019t \u2013 they like that \u2013 so it\u2019s kind of like I\u2019ve found my home.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Martinho for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having already worked himself into the starting lineup as the lone striker (ahead of the former Manchester City player J\u00f4) Kazim-Richards received a standing ovation from the crowd as he was substituted after 80 bruising minutes against their bitter rivals Palmeiras last week. He may have lost a yard or two of pace but you can never question his commitment. The fans cheered loudly as he flicked the ball over Felipe Melo\u2019s head in the second half: \u201cKazim! Kazim! Kazim!\u201d Corinthians fans often prize determination over skill and expect nothing less than blood, sweat and tears. \u201cTraining is a match and a match is war,\u201d as the ultras here like to say.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of teams get tired of that and I can see that Corinthians won\u2019t \u2013 they like that \u2013 so it\u2019s kind of like I\u2019ve found my home.\u201d</p> <p>So will he and his Brazilian family finally settle here? Can he see himself retiring in Brazil? \u201cIf it was me, yeah. But I\u2019ve gotta think about my kids, you know, schooling and further education. But we\u2019ll always have a home here, one million per cent.\u201d</p> <p>Wherever he goes next, Kazim\u2011Richards does seem to have found peace and maybe a little of what he has been searching for all this time. \u201cIt\u2019s educating, they teach me stuff every day about myself,\u201d he says about his young children, \u201cand about the world. It\u2019s just made me have finally, some\u00a0\u2026\u00a0What\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for?

For someone who comes from where I come from, to have seen and done what I have, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fantasy.\u201d In sports journalism, however, players are often reduced to caricatures and Kazim-Richards has been placed in the \u201cbad boy\u201d and the \u201cjourneyman\u201d categories. Sitting with him after training, however, he is charming, thoughtful and engaging. Swaggering out of the changing rooms and into the boiling Brazilian sunshine for a couple of hours\u2019 training, he greets everyone warmly, kisses the team\u2019s press officer good morning as he passes, speaking Portuguese almost without an accent. The first thing you notice is the size of the man. He is easily the biggest player in the squad, the dark blue Corinthians training top clinging tightly to him whereas it rather hangs off some of the others. He is built more like a rugby player these days and looks like an action hero. There is more to Kazim-Richards than just muscles, though. In fact, there seem to be two Colin Kazim-Richards\u2019s. First there is the warrior we see on the pitch. \u201cI\u2019m \u2018ride or die\u2019 for my team whoever or wherever they are. If you\u2019re messing with my guy on the pitch, I\u2019m taking charge of that. If you\u2019re trying to bully someone, I\u2019m taking charge of that. What needs to be said to the coach, OK, I\u2019ll say it. And that\u2019s been my downfall. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re a general, innit, hahaha.\u201d Then there is the man we do not see too often: the worrier. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep after games. I go over and over everything. I could fall asleep at 7am and then wake up at 8am with my kids.\u201d This is a man who sees what is going on around him and quietly offers help; someone who always has food and water in his car to give to those less fortunate. In Brazil, there is no escaping the poverty. \u201cSometimes it makes you upset, like it makes you feel selfish: \u2018Should I really be enjoying my day?\u2019\u201d To try to fully understand this \u201cone-off\u201d player and his unorthodox trajectory, however, we need to go right back to the start. His Turkish-Cypriot, Muslim mother was evacuated from the Mediterranean island by the British army after a military coup in 1974. His father is a Rastafarian, born to Antiguan Christian parents, and used to get attacked just for stepping out with her. \u201cI\u2019d say from round about 1983 you start seeing mixed-race babies [in London]. It wasn\u2019t the norm. So my mum and dad had all that. My dad, especially, had skinheads beating him up, going to wars with them in Walthamstow.\u201d Kaz, as he is known to his friends back home, is as London as they come but has always felt Turkish, attended Turkish school as a child and spoke the language at home with his mum and \u201cnene\u201d (grandma). Asked whether he feels English at all, Kazim-Richards hesitates before giving his answer, knowing full well that his responses can, and do, get taken the wrong way. He confirms that he never had dreams of playing for England and if he does have roots anywhere, they\u2019re not in his country of birth. \u201cMy blood is not English, if you know what I\u2019m saying? Growing up it was Caribbean in my house and it was Turkish. I never ate fish and chips growing up, my mum cooked Turkish food and West Indian food. For a family, we\u2019re so far away from [being] English. \u201cI respect England. They didn\u2019t give my mum and dad anything but they gave us \u2026 a platform. And then it was down to my mum and dad and all our families to be able to try and make something out of it. Which 95% of us have failed to do. I\u2019m lucky, my dad and my mum had more perseverance with me and I was able to make something of my life but a lot of my cousins and a lot of friends are in jail or&nbsp;dead.\u201d After being rejected by Arsenal, Kazim-Richards made what he says was the most difficult move of his life. \u201cI\u2019m from London and I moved to Bury \u2013 that\u2019s been the hardest move ever, culturally. There were no black people up there and food was hard for me. All that rolled into one. And then you go into training and people think it\u2019s funny to put bananas on your peg and then people think it\u2019s funny to cut up your shoes but what people don\u2019t realise is my dad don\u2019t have money. \u201cI was on \u00a345 a week \u2013 I can\u2019t buy new shoes every week. Cutting up your laces and putting a hole in your crotch on your trousers and shit like that. They don\u2019t understand how hard my dad works \u2026 I used to clean my trainers with a toothbrush.\u201d Would he describe that as \u201cfootball banter\u201d or racism? \u201cThe first time I think it\u2019s more ignorance, but then it really is racism after that, because they\u2019re not listening, they still think it\u2019s funny. And then you retaliate and you get labelled a bad boy,\u201d he says. He has had to deal with racism all his life and appeared in court after making a \u201chomophobic\u201d gesture towards Brighton fans in 2013. He does not regret it. \u201cI\u2019ve got more racism in England for being Turkish than being black. That \u2018homophobic\u2019 thing all started from people calling me a Turkish kebab. \u2018Go back to Turkey, you fucking Turkish kebab!\u2019 People have quoted that I\u2019ve got charged with homophobia but I didn\u2019t, I got charged with public disorder.\u201d Kazim-Richards does not see any difference between what he did and what the Brighton fans were doing to him and he feels the colour of his skin has made it easier for people to label him a bad boy. \u201cI think if I was a different colour, my career would be held up as an example rather than \u2018ah, he\u2019s a journeyman\u2019, because I don\u2019t suit the label. \u201cI\u2019ve played for some of the biggest teams in the world, I\u2019m here now playing for one of the biggest teams in the world. And I just think if someone else did it, with a different name, different colour skin, they\u2019d be, like: \u2018Look, you see! England\u2019s not the only way.\u2019\u201d Kazim-Richards feels a lot of players are judged differently because of their race and because of where they come from. \u201cLook at Raheem [Sterling] and [Paul] Pogba, for example, when they don\u2019t have a good game everybody comes down on them for like, crazy stuff. Crazy stuff. And then you look at other players&nbsp;\u2026\u201d He trails off, letting the silence hang in the air. \u201cEveryone\u2019s quiet. I\u2019m not gonna say the names. Nobody has the same talks. Like I see a piece in the paper about Raheem in the pound shop and people are taking the piss like: \u2018Woah! He\u2019s earning this amount.\u2019 What? He can\u2019t shop at the pound shop?\u201d In Turkey he says he never had a problem being accepted \u201cbecause they saw it as I picked Turkey over England. Which I did at that time.\u201d Pulling on the national colours of Turkey are his fondest on-pitch memories to date. His voice softens. \u201cWhen I played for the national team the people loved me, bro. Loved me. And that\u2019s one thing that I love about it \u2013 it\u2019s a different kind of love. It makes you cry, playing for a nation like that.\u201d More outspoken on political issues than most players on his Twitter feed, he often posts messages about what is happening in Turkey. Last year, after scoring the decider for Coritiba in a local derby, he screamed, \u201cFuck terrorism! I love Turkey!\u201d down the camera lens and posted the video on Twitter with the message \u2018together we are stronger\u2019. \u201cThese are kids that are getting blown up,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Turkey you don\u2019t have a choice about joining the military; my cousins have done it. My friend\u2019s dad got blown up on the bus. Umut Bulut, I played with him at Galatasaray and the national team \u2026 His dad got blown up in Ankara on the bus. And he\u2019s one of the nicest guys I\u2019ve ever met. That shit is painful.\u201d A product of the English system, Kazim-Richards now occupies a place well outside it, having returned only once in the past 10 years for a season\u2019s loan at Blackburn. Why don\u2019t more English players travel then? \u201cThey\u2019re comfy. It\u2019s not portrayed in the media, \u2018You can do this, you can go there\u2019. Everything is England, England, England. I\u2019ve seen guys that got released from Manchester United and rather than even going down to London to a League One or Championship side they\u2019re staying in Manchester playing amateur&nbsp;football.\u201d He complains that English football is too closed and suffers from \u201cnepotism, jobs for the boys, prejudice and the belief that only those in control are correct\u201d. Kazim-Richards believes that the system is not built for guys such as him to succeed. \u201cIf you look like me and beg to differ you are ostracised.\u201d To try to address this perceived imbalance, he now invests heavily in a youth team, Kazim Richards Academy, in London. He likes to be there, when he can, to offer advice and guidance, something he said he missed growing up. \u201cWhen I go and talk to the kids, I tell them, you can do anything you wanna do wherever you wanna do it.\u201d Even in football, one of the great levellers, Kazim-Richards feels that diversity is discouraged. \u201cIn England the last thing they judge you on is your football ability and the first thing they judge you on is: \u2018Look what he\u2019s got on today, look at that line in his hair.\u2019 Bro, that\u2019s where I\u2019m from, you see?\u201d He now finds himself at a struggling team, trying to rebuild itself, and is getting used to the topsy-turvy world of Brazilian football. Corinthians were Brazilian champions in 2015 but then lost their manager, Tite, to the national squad and have not been the same since. Fans and staff at the club have clearly warmed to him and he has been given the moniker of \u201cGringo da favela\u201d. Corinthians are known in S\u00e3o Paulo as the team of the marginalised. Enter any favela in the city and Corinthians shirts easily outnumber those of their local rivals, S\u00e3o Paulo, Palmeiras and Santos. \u201cI tried to explain to them that, OK, I\u2019m not from your favela, we don\u2019t have favelas, but I\u2019m from an area that has the same injustices and the same kind of politics.\u201d Having already worked himself into the starting lineup as the lone striker (ahead of the former Manchester City player J\u00f4) Kazim-Richards received a standing ovation from the crowd as he was substituted after 80 bruising minutes against their bitter rivals Palmeiras last week. He may have lost a yard or two of pace but you can never question his commitment. The fans cheered loudly as he flicked the ball over Felipe Melo\u2019s head in the second half: \u201cKazim! Kazim! Kazim!\u201d Corinthians fans often prize determination over skill and expect nothing less than blood, sweat and tears. \u201cTraining is a match and a match is war,\u201d as the ultras here like to say. \u201cA lot of teams get tired of that and I can see that Corinthians won\u2019t \u2013 they like that \u2013 so it\u2019s kind of like I\u2019ve found my home.\u201d So will he and his Brazilian family finally settle here? Can he see himself retiring in Brazil? \u201cIf it was me, yeah. But I\u2019ve gotta think about my kids, you know, schooling and further education. But we\u2019ll always have a home here, one million per cent.\u201d Wherever he goes next, Kazim\u2011Richards does seem to have found peace and maybe a little of what he has been searching for all this time. \u201cIt\u2019s educating, they teach me stuff every day about myself,\u201d he says about his young children, \u201cand about the world. It\u2019s just made me have finally, some&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;What\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for? Oh yes, unconditional love.\u201d",

The new documentary <a href=\"http://www.ghfilmcentre.org/en/films/423\">Mr Gay Syria</a> should serve as a corrective to any such complacency.</p> <p>Its title has about it the whiff of a tasteless joke. So successfully has Islamic State disseminated its doctrine of hatred that the mere idea of gay Syrians calls to mind gay men and boys being thrown to their death from rooftops. But that was one of the reasons why Mahmoud Hassino, who works with LGBT refugees in Berlin, set up a contest last year to find a Syrian entrant to compete in <a href=\"http://www.mrgayworld.com/\">Mr Gay World</a> 2016. That process is now the subject of Ay\u015fe Toprak\u2019s insightful and sensitive film. \u201cMahmoud was so fed up of everyone associating gay Syrians with those killings,\u201d she tells me on the phone from her home in Istanbul. \u201cHe wanted to say: \u2018Look, we live. We fight.\u2019 He wanted the world to know about the living gay Syrians, not just the dead ones.\u201d</p> <p>Toprak\u2019s film presents the lives of a handful of the contestants, all of them refugees living in Istanbul, as they prepare for the big event. The main focus is on Hussein, a hairdresser who is closeted from his family and has the added complication of an infant daughter. There is also Omar, an infectiously jolly cook, and Wissam, who plans to win over the judges with a combination of Minnie Mouse ears, heels and hot pants. Such tomfoolery serves a vital function. Though the picture begins with a Gay Pride parade being violently disrupted by police, the instances of oppression and homophobia are outnumbered by scenes depicting matter-of-factly the lives of these resilient men who have, as Hussein puts it, arrived at courage by way of despair. \u201cThe contest itself was really celebratory,\u201d says Toprak. \u201cIt\u2019s part of their struggle that they want to laugh and have fun in order to stay alive. Everyone in that room felt proud of who they were.\u201d</p> <p>Even for these Syrians who have made it to Turkey, life continues to be arduous: as immigrants they have no rights and cannot legally work, Toprak explains, so they often end up putting themselves at risk in the sex industry. But she made a choice early on to tell a more hopeful story. \u201cThe misery of the Syrian crisis somehow ends up overwhelming what is underneath. People get tired of it and stop listening or watching. Mahmoud said to me: \u2018If I\u2019m always crying, it\u2019s like I don\u2019t exist.\u2019 He needs to have fun with life to feel he\u2019s still living it. Look at his Mr Gay Syria idea. Who would hold a beauty contest in the middle of this crisis? It\u2019s crazy! But it\u2019s actually a way of surviving.\u201d She also decided not to feature Hussein\u2019s claim, which he has made in a number of newspaper interviews, that one of his former boyfriends was murdered by Isis. Was he lying? \u201cI don\u2019t know. He made that claim to us but I didn\u2019t want to include it because there is no way of verifying it. Sometimes people will very naively use the media to make their situation more tragic than it is. But even if it\u2019s a lie, the fact that someone has to make up stuff like that shows how desperate they are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e978e935e33fb267742bf42fa3a07381e139c87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e978e935e33fb267742bf42fa3a07381e139c87/101_0_2814_1688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Mr Gay Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Mr Gay Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Les Films D'Antoine/Coin Film/Toprak Film</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no shortage of hardship in the film already. One of the contestants receives a death threat from his own father, while the eventual winner of the Syrian heat has to endure a protracted visa application process to discover whether or not he can travel to the final in Malta.</p> <p>At least the production itself went relatively smoothly. Shooting a film about gay Syrian refugees in Istanbul is surprisingly easy, it turns out, as long as you don\u2019t tell anyone you\u2019re shooting a film about gay Syrian refugees in Istanbul. \u201cThis project became so many other different films along the way,\u201d Toprak laughs. \u201cWhenever we were stopped by police or officials, we would say we were making a film about the cultural institutions of Istanbul called The Joys of Life. We were very well-rehearsed.\u201d</p> <p>One institution that emerges from the film without much distinction is <a href=\"http://www.mrgayworld.com/\">Mr Gay World</a>. Though its website is full of high-minded sentiments (the aim of the annual contest, it states, is to remind us that \u201cin many regions on our planet being gay is a challenge and a fight for basic human rights\u201d), those who run Mr Gay World appear not to have noticed that the Syrian case represented an opportunity to put those words into action. The organisers responded to my email inquiries about their failure to help the Syrian contestants by insisting that \u201cno further comments will be made\u201d but the proof is in the picture. Even when it seems that the man crowned Mr Gay Syria will be prevented from reaching Malta, no offer is made for him to participate via Skype, and no one associated with Mr Gay World realises that bestowing the title on him in absentia would send a positive message of solidarity.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a big disappointment for all of us,\u201d Toprak agrees. \u201cThe organisation says it\u2019s not just a beauty contest, that it\u2019s all about human rights, but when you get there, you find there\u2019s no media presence. I think they were actually scared of having a Mr Gay Syria in there. For the honour and the symbolism, they could have given him the prize. Instead, they said: \u2018No, he has to be here in person.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The contest itself proved to be an inconsequential affair (\u201cIt\u2019s boring \u2013 that\u2019s why you only see 40 seconds or so on screen\u201d) and merely the jumping-off point for the rest of the movie. \u201cWe always had back-up plans. Our plan B was to rent a boat and take the winner there ourselves. We did look into it. We checked out which yachts tend not to get stopped. Then we came to our senses. \u2018Oh my God, no, that\u2019s smuggling people in. That has consequences!\u2019 Even Mr Gay Syria was, like, \u2018You\u2019re being ridiculous.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As the film gets ready to hit the festival circuit, Toprak is aware of the possible consequences of exposure. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to show it in Turkey because Hussein is still there,\u201d she tells me. \u201cHe says sometimes that he is scared but he has also told me he stands by the film 100%. It is not necessarily any harder now for LGBT people in Turkey \u2013 it is simply harder now for women, Kurds, everyone. It\u2019s a claustrophobic society.\u201d The irony of releasing the film as the US government fights to keep its travel ban in place, including an indefinite clampdown on Syrian refugees, is not lost on the film-maker. \u201cWhen that was announced, it felt like the whole world was collapsing.\u201d</p> <p>She sees a glimmer of hope, though, in this week\u2019s Oscar results. \u201cMoonlight is an amazing, significant film and I\u2019m sure it will have an impact on other films. You see that all the time in the documentary world \u2013 films have managed to change policy, change lives.\u201d Does her own film have that potential? \u201cA friend of mine who watched it said: \u2018It made me wish something good would happen to these guys.\u2019 That\u2019s an important feeling. If everyone who sees it feels that way, it may not change policy, but perhaps it will make us feel closer to people we fear.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 To contribute to Mr Gay Syria\u2019 crowdfunding campaign visit <a href=\"https://www.kisskissbankbank.com/mr-gay-syria-film\">kisskissbankbank</a></p>",

You see that all the time in the documentary world \u2013 films have managed to change policy, change lives.\u201d Does her own film have that potential? \u201cA friend of mine who watched it said: \u2018It made me wish something good would happen to these guys.\u2019 That\u2019s an important feeling.

      "bodyText": "The hastily convened global gathering of governments in Brussels to pledge tens of millions of euros to family planning charities who had their US funding pulled by Donald Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cglobal gag\u201d has been a tightrope to walk for the British government. Trump reinstated the rule by executive order in his first few days in the White House, meaning US government funding cannot be provided to charities whose work includes offering abortion services. Perhaps more than any other country, the UK has been keen to demonstrate that, whatever the concerns about the Trump administration, the answer is engagement rather than isolation. In January, Theresa May became the first foreign leader to meet the US president on a trip criticised by some as overly hasty. Given the UK\u2019s need for new and fast free trade partners after the exit from the EU, such a position is perhaps unavoidable. Viewed through this prism, its decision to send Rory Stewart, a junior minister, rather than Priti Patel, the secretary of state for international development, could be interpreted as a mild snub to the She Decides conference, an event intended by its organisers to be a symbol of solidarity against Trump. Ditto the UK decision not to pledge any additional money, when countries from Norway to the Netherlands are stumping up millions. But that is not how ministers at the Department for International Development see it. They say they have been planning to host their own major global summit on family planning over the summer with the UN and that \u2013 far from ignoring the issue \u2013 the department has intensified UK aid efforts on family planning. Observers might detect a sense of irritation that the UK will now be put in a position where it is a follower, rather than a leader, given that this week\u2019s conference has been convened by the Dutch, Belgian and other northern European nations. However, critics have warned that the determination of the department to forge its own path, rather than be perceived as embarrassing Trump, could leave charities in limbo, without specific pledges that their loss of support from the US will be matched elsewhere. That uncertainty could have long-term consequences for reproductive health in developing countries. About half of all abortion procedures worldwide \u2013 more than 20m \u2013 are unsafe, with the vast majority in developing countries. About 68,000 women die annually after backstreet abortions, making it one of the leading causes of maternal mortality, according to the World Health Organization. Five Labour MPs wrote in January to Patel to urge her to commit emergency funding to the She Decides effort, arguing that policymaking needed to be reactive to a volatile political climate. \u201cWe would implore you to take urgent steps on funding and policy as the Dutch government has, and as the UK government has done so previously, to mitigate the impact of this decision,\u201d they wrote. At least one of the MPs is speaking from experience. Gareth Thomas was a minister at DfID in 2006 when the Labour government publicly defied George W Bush\u2019s own reinstatement of the global gag rule to pledge money for safe abortion services where US funding had been cut off. At the time, the International Planned Parenthood Federation praised the bravery of the UK, saying they were \u201cdeeply grateful for the gesture not only financially but politically\u201d. Any kind of similar statement of thanks from charities in 2017 would be deeply unhelpful to the Conservative government in the post-Brexit era, connecting international aid spending to diplomacy.

      "bodyText": "Police have launched a murder inquiry after an 80-year-old woman was found dead at an allotment in north-west London. The body of Lea Adri-Soejoko, 80, was discovered inside a lockup store at the site in Sheaveshill Avenue, Colindale, on Tuesday morning, the Metropolitan police said. Officers said they did not know why anyone would have targeted her. A postmortem took place on Wednesday. Scotland Yard has not yet disclosed how she died, except to say it was \u201cin the most tragic way possible\u201d. Adri-Soejoko, who lived near the allotments, was reported missing at about 1.40am on Tuesday. Officers arrived at the scene of her death 25 minutes later. She was last seen alive at 6.30pm on Sunday, and spoke to a friend on the phone at 2.30pm on Monday, police said. \u201cShe was due to attend a meeting in the Barnet area around gardening and good practice and she did not turn up to that meeting,\u201d said DCI Noel McHugh, of the Met\u2019s homicide and major crime command. \u201cSo a friend became concerned and then alerted family members.\u201d Neighbour Danila Catruta, 39, said she had been left scared by the murder: \u201cSince I heard about it I keep thinking about the situation. How can people do this? I feel very sorry about what happened because no one should be treated like this.\u201d Adri-Soejoko was listed as secretary of the Colindale Allotment and Garden Association at the 95-plot site and neighbours said she could often be seen tending her own garden. Window cleaner Eddie Volkovskig, 24, told the Evening Standard: \u201cI saw police cars a few times in the road but didn\u2019t think anything of it. Lea was very friendly and very happy. \u201cShe was always looking after her plants and when I was growing tomatoes she would give me tips. I last saw her a couple of weeks ago.\u201d On the day of her disappearance Adri-Soejoko is believed to have been wearing a blue quilted jacket, grey bottoms and black boots with white spots and pink piping. Police are yet to establish a motive for the killing. They said they were looking to account for everybody who was in the allotments between Sunday evening and Tuesday morning, amid reports homeless people have been sleeping in or around the area recently. McHugh said: \u201cAt the moment we do not have a motive for Lea\u2019s murder and I am appealing to the public to help us piece together her movements before her death. \u201cI want to trace anyone who saw Lea or spoke to her from about midday on Sunday through to when she was reported missing. \u201cHad anything happened in her life that we should be aware of that might provide a motive for what happened? If you have any information at all, no matter how small, please contact us. \u201cI am particularly keen to speak to anyone with links to these allotments, who might have visited or been in or around the area throughout Monday 27 February into the early hours of the following morning. \u201cAn elderly woman lost her life in the most tragic way possible and was left inside a storage unit similar to a garage. If you know anything please contact us.\u201d He reassured residents that patrols have been increased in the area. Anyone with information is asked to contact the incident room on 020 8785 8099 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.",

Delivering Channel 4\u2019s annual diversity lecture in Parliament, Ahmed said that in the light of the rise in racial and religious hate crimes post-Brexit, TV had a pivotal role to play in ensuring different communities felt heard, and valued, in British society. \u201cIf we fail to represent, we are in danger of losing people to extremism,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the mind of the Isis recruit, he\u2019s the next James Bond right? Have you seen some of those Isis propaganda videos, they are cut like action movies. Where is the counter narrative? Where are we telling these kids they can be heroes in our stories, that they valued?\u201d Ahmed\u2019s recent roles include the HBO drama The Night Of and comedy series Girls, both American TV shows. Like Idris Elba, who delivered the lecture last year, Ahmed used the platform to criticise the fact he still had to go to the US to land major parts. \u201cIt takes American remakes of British shows to cast someone like me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe end up going to America to find work. I meet with producers and directors here and they say \u2018we don\u2019t have anything for you, all our stories are set in Cornwall in the 1600s\u2019.\u201d Ahmed said British television still perceived diversity as a \u201cfrill or an added extra\u201d and that if it is not addressed immediately, it would create more divisions across the country. \u201cPeople are looking for the message that they belong, that they are part of something, that they are seen and heard and that despite, or perhaps because of, their experience, they are valued. They want to feel represented. In that task we have failed.\u201d He added: \u201cIf we don\u2019t step up and tell a representative story \u2026 we are going to start losing British teenagers to the story that the next chapter in their lives is written with Isis in Syria. We are going to see the murder of more MPs like Jo Cox because we\u2019ve been mis-sold a story that is so narrow about who we are and who we should be.\u201d Ahmed said while growing up, the lack of Asian faces and stories on television had made him believe it was impossible for him to become an actor. It was only that several people had helped to champion him, and offered financial aid, that he made it to drama school and then landed his first film role. He recalled that whenever actors such as Meera Syal or Sanjeev Bhaskar made rare appearances on TV \u201call of sudden I\u2019d hear my mum shout \u2018ASIAN\u2019 and I\u2019d run downstairs just to watch \u2026 I really want you to understand how much that meant to someone who doesn\u2019t see themselves reflected back in culture. It\u2019s a message that you matter.\u201d Ahmed called on the government to act, particularly to overturn the unconscious bias in hiring that was preventing talented people from black, Asian and minority backgrounds rising up the ranks. He said public money should be tied to representation targets for broadcasters to break the cycle of top jobs going mainly to white men. His talk came on the same day that BBC director generalTony Hall admitted that the BBC and other broadcasters favoured the \u201cwell-connected and well-off\u201d from the southeast. Hall told a conference that the television industry is a sector that was \u201ctoo often the source of social exclusion\u201d. In 2015, BBC, Channel 4 and ITV and Sky launched the Diamond Project to monitor diversity across all broadcasters, while Ofcom said it may impose tougher penalties. By 2020 the BBC aims to have 15% of its workforce from black and ethnic minority backgrounds.",

Either way, let\u2019s have a look at it.</p> <p>Back in 1972, Ricky <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/dec/27/ricky-tomlinson-interview-im-a-whingeing-scouser\" title=\"\">took part in the first national building workers\u2019 strike</a>, organised by a rank-and-file body known as the Building Workers\u2019 Charter. He and 23 other strikers, who <a href=\"http://www.shrewsbury24campaign.org.uk/\" title=\"\">became known as the Shrewsbury 24</a>, were arrested for conspiracy to intimidate, unlawful assembly and affray, and were put on trial in a controversial case that they have always maintained was politically motivated. It ended in 24 convictions, with Tomlinson handed a two-year sentence in 1973. He spent much of his year inside in solitary, including a\u00a022-day hunger strike.</p> <p>So, where does Richard Whiteley come into it all? Well, a documentary about the case was made by Yorkshire Television, produced by Woodrow Wyatt. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7603ed62\" title=\"\">The Red Under the Bed</a> was broadcast on the very day the prosecution completed its case, in the rather more freewheeling era before the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/49/contents\" title=\"\">Contempt of Court Act</a>.

Furthermore, the screening of the documentary was followed by a half-hour studio discussion hosted by Whiteley, whose <a href=\"https://goo.gl/XdrkkM\" title=\"\">final question, posed to the Tory MP Geoffrey Stewart-Smith</a>, ran: \u201cCan you give me one example in 1973 of blatant communist influence?\u201d Stewart-Smith cited organised violence in the building strike by the Building Workers\u2019 Charter. The jury went on to convict by a 10-2 majority.</p> <p>Fast forward to the present day, and Ricky \u2013 who has never given up his protest against the conviction \u2013 announced: \u201cWe found out this week that the film was designed, written, made and paid for by the security services.

He would have had to have been \u201cthe best in the business\u201d, says Gyles, because he never said a word about it to him, even late at night when they were pissed. I\u00a0do like this reasoning, as though not disclosing something to Gyles Brandreth is a guarantee it can\u2019t be true. And yet \u2013 judging by the form book, Whiteley might have wisely assumed Gyles would have been giving the anecdote a second runout on The One Show before he had got even rid of the hangover. You know what they say: careless talk costs \u00a35k for an after-dinner speech.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Richard\u2019s friend and former colleague Jonathan Aitken says that the presenter was once remarkably interested in an interview Aitken had conducted with Anthony Eden about the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, but warns: \u201cFrom what I know about Mr Tomlinson, I would sup with a very long spoon.\u201d High praise from Aitken, whose libel action against this newspaper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/aitken/0,2759,183781,00.html\" title=\"\">collapsed before the legal team were able to formally defend the allegations that he pimped for his Saudi contacts</a>. But perhaps he refers to Ricky\u2019s period in the National Front, which he joined in 1968 over immigration and the wrong sort of people getting council houses (his views had travelled leftwards by the very early 70s).</p> <p>Finally, there is Whiteley\u2019s long-term partner, Kathryn Apanowicz, whose advice to Ricky \u201cwould be to take more water with it\u201d. \u201cIf Richard was a member of the secret service,\u201d she judges, \u201cmaybe Ken Dodd was in charge of MI5.\u201d Having gone on to say that Whiteley couldn\u2019t even work the VCR, she concludes: \u201cI think Richard will be up there with Terry Wogan having a good laugh at the idea of him being a\u00a0spy.\u201d</p> <p>Or is Richard up there in the celestial equivalent of MI5 \u2013 and I\u2019m not ruling Wogan out of it \u2013 having a bloody serious discussion about commies with Cary Grant?

I&nbsp;do like this reasoning, as though not disclosing something to Gyles Brandreth is a guarantee it can\u2019t be true. And yet \u2013 judging by the form book, Whiteley might have wisely assumed Gyles would have been giving the anecdote a second runout on The One Show before he had got even rid of the hangover. You know what they say: careless talk costs \u00a35k for an after-dinner speech. Elsewhere, Richard\u2019s friend and former colleague Jonathan Aitken says that the presenter was once remarkably interested in an interview Aitken had conducted with Anthony Eden about the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, but warns: \u201cFrom what I know about Mr Tomlinson, I would sup with a very long spoon.\u201d High praise from Aitken, whose libel action against this newspaper collapsed before the legal team were able to formally defend the allegations that he pimped for his Saudi contacts. But perhaps he refers to Ricky\u2019s period in the National Front, which he joined in 1968 over immigration and the wrong sort of people getting council houses (his views had travelled leftwards by the very early 70s). Finally, there is Whiteley\u2019s long-term partner, Kathryn Apanowicz, whose advice to Ricky \u201cwould be to take more water with it\u201d. \u201cIf Richard was a member of the secret service,\u201d she judges, \u201cmaybe Ken Dodd was in charge of MI5.\u201d Having gone on to say that Whiteley couldn\u2019t even work the VCR, she concludes: \u201cI think Richard will be up there with Terry Wogan having a good laugh at the idea of him being a&nbsp;spy.\u201d Or is Richard up there in the celestial equivalent of MI5 \u2013 and I\u2019m not ruling Wogan out of it \u2013 having a bloody serious discussion about commies with Cary Grant? We simply don\u2019t have the evidence to discount the possibility, and must leave this file open until we do.",

The global status of this brand provides significant opportunities and we are excited to begin working to further grow the brand equity.\u201d Sports Direct said it was \u201cfully supportive\u201d of the deal but did not provide details about if or how it will work with the Agent Provocateur. A spokesman said: \u201cWe have a 25% shareholding in Four Marketing and we are fully supportive of this acquisition.\u201d Agent Provocateur has struggled in recent years. Accounting irregularities were uncovered within the business last year, which were investigated by KPMG. This investigation found material misstatement in the way stock, costs and liabilities had been reported over a number of years. 3i wrote down the value of its 80% stake in the business by \u00a339m to reflect its problems, which included slowing sales. The private equity firm is unlikely to receive any of the proceeds from the sale. The structure of the deal as a pre-pack administration mean the funds will be paid to creditors of Agent Provocateur. 3i has claimed it provided funding to prop up the brand last year and tried to bring in investment to allow it to continue as a going concern, which was not possible. The brand employs around 600 people and has 11 shops in the UK. It was co-founded in 1994 by Corr\u00e9 and his now former wife Serena Rees. Its first shop was in Soho, London. 3i bought its stake for an estimated \u00a360m in 2007. At the time, Rees said: \u201cWe have provoked thought and reaction; we brought lingerie to the forefront of fashion, brought sexuality out into the open and have given sex a sense of luxury.\u201d Corr\u00e9 initially stayed with the company as creative director but left in 2009 and later sold his remaining shares. He was involved in a legal dispute with 3i before it sold the business to Ashley. Corr\u00e9 and Rees were both awarded MBEs for their services to the fashion industry in 2007 but Corr\u00e9 rejected the award, describing the then prime minister, Tony Blair, as \u201cmorally corrupt\u201d and not \u201csomeone capable of giving an honour\u201d. Corr\u00e9 claimed that 3i rejected a higher offer from Quadro Capital, an investment firm, that would have protected jobs and creditors. He said Ashley will \u201cpick at a carcass\u201d and plans \u201cto the keep the brand and the stock and nothing much else\u201d. However, sources close to 3i insist it had played no role in the selection of the buyer and that the sale process had been taken over by AlixPartners on behalf of Barclays after the failure to attract new investment into Agent Provocateur.",
