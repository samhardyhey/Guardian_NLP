The inquiry arose amid concerns among Coalition politicians that the act restricts free speech, particularly section 18C, which says it is unlawful for a person to do an act in public which is \u201creasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\u201d another person or a group of people. So, given all the discussion of the act by politicians, how frequent are racial discrimination complaints and how many of them result in court action? The Australian Human Rights Commission publishes detailed statistics on complaints it receives in its annual reports. The AHRC handles complaints under a number of acts, including the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act, the Age Discrimination Act and the Australian Human Rights Commission Act. Here are the number of complaints under each act for the past 10 years \u2013 this shows all complaints under the Racial Discrimination Act, not just those relating to section 18C: On average, there were about 418 racial discrimination complaints a year. Within those racial discrimination complaints, there were still fewer complaints that specifically related to section 18C, with only 77 in the last financial year: Of the complaints relating to section 18C, the majority concerned employment, with 25 out of 77 complaints in this area: The majority of all racial discrimination complaints were resolved in a conciliation process with the AHRC, with 70% of complaints in the 2015-16 financial year resolved in this way: Complaints were disproportionately made by people of Indigenous background, with 54% of complainants identifying as Indigenous in 2015-16. When complaints are not resolved by conciliation, complainants can take the complaint to court. Figures compiled by SBS from the AHRC show court cases are rare, with fewer than 5% of complaints making it to court, and the majority of these court cases resulted in the complaint being dismissed: More recent figures provided by the AHRC to Guardian Australia showed only one application to the courts in 2015-16 regarding a complaint relating to section 18C and five in 2014-15.",

The spokesman described Vargas as an \u201cunlawfully present Argentinian citizen\u201d. </p> <p>Vargas\u2019s brother and father were arrested and detained in February after Ice agents arrived at their family home.

      "bodyText": "A young woman applying for the renewal of her Daca status was arrested and detained by immigration agents in Jackson, Mississippi, on Wednesday, shortly after she addressed a press conference in support of undocumented migrants\u2019 rights. Daniela Vargas, a 22-year-old who came to the US as a seven-year-old child from Cordoba, Argentina, had told the rally how she dreamed of returning to college and becoming a math teacher, according to her attorneys. Shortly after the event, as she was driven along an interstate highway by a friend, she was pulled over by Immigration and Customs Agents (Ice) and arrested, said immigration attorney Nathan Elmore. Vargas had been a recipient of Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program, which allows undocumented migrants relief from deportation and education and work rights. But her Daca status had recently expired, with her attorneys lodging an unresolved renewal application in recent weeks, Elmore said. \u201cShe is not a danger to society. She is a good person who can contribute and she\u2019s the sort of person that the Daca legislation envisaged. It was correct for her to be under there, and we hope she can get under that statute again,\u201d said Elmore. \u201cBut first we have to get her out of jail.\u201d The Trump administration has empowered immigration agents to effectively target most, if not all, of America\u2019s 11 million undocumented migrants for deportation under sweeping reforms that vastly expand the agency\u2019s powers. Nonetheless, the president has been cautious to comment on the Daca program, which still remain in place. Homeland security officials have suggested that Daca recipients will not be a priority for deportation. Ice spokesman Thomas Byrd did not respond to a set of questions from the Guardian but confirmed that Vargas has been arrested by agents during a so-called \u201ctargeted immigration enforcement action\u201d. The spokesman described Vargas as an \u201cunlawfully present Argentinian citizen\u201d. Vargas\u2019s brother and father were arrested and detained in February after Ice agents arrived at their family home. Vargas told local media at the time she had hid in her bedroom closet out of fear, and was eventually handcuffed by officers who broke down her door after a five-hour standoff. On that occasion, however, Vargas was released. \u201cDuring that time, I couldn\u2019t even breathe, honestly,\u201d Vargas told the Clarion Ledger in February. \u201cI just watched them handcuff my dad and take them. I was scared for my life. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know anything. I called my mom and I just let out a cry. I didn\u2019t even get to see my brother leave; I think that was the harshest thing for me.\u201d Ice said they moved to verify Vargas\u2019s immigration status after the incident on 15 February and her case will now be referred to an immigration judge. Elmore said his firm had not heard from Vargas since her arrest earlier on Wednesday, but he believed she had been transferred to Ice detention in Louisiana. He would not comment on whether the arrest was retaliation for Vargas\u2019s conversations with the media. Since Trump has assumed office, a handful of Daca recipients have been apprehended by Ice agents and remain in detention. \u201cEvery day, as part of routine targeted enforcement operations, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Fugitive Operations teams arrest criminal aliens and other individuals who are in violation of our nation\u2019s immigration laws,\u201d Byrd said in a statement. \u201cIce conducts targeted immigration enforcement in compliance with federal law and agency policy. Ice does not conduct sweeps or raids that target aliens indiscriminately.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull has poured cold water on a proposal to grandfather penalty rate cuts to protect the rates of existing workers but apply the cuts to new workers immediately. Turnbull has said the government supports the objective that workers\u2019 take-home pay should be protected but it was up to the Fair Work Commission to decide how to do that. On Thursday the former employment minister, Eric Abetz, called for Sunday penalty rate cuts in four industries to be grandfathered \u201censure that no worker is worse off while allowing new opportunities for the unemployed and especially for young unemployed people\u201d. Labor has rejected the proposal, arguing high turnover in the retail, hospitality, fast food and pharmacy industries will mean grandfathering is insufficient protection for workers. Grandfathering could also result in employers rostering new casual employees on Sunday shifts, helping them access the lower pay rates and still lowering the take-home pay of existing workers by offering them less lucrative shifts. On Friday Guardian Australia reported that the cuts of between 25 to 50% in Sunday rates could be grandfathered, instead of phased in over a number of years, as a means to protect current workers from cuts. On Thursday on ABC\u2019s AM, Malcolm Turnbull reiterated the government\u2019s support for the independent Fair Work Commission, but declined to comment on the substance of its decision. At a press conference Turnbull said the evidence was \u201cvery strong\u201d that it was more affordable for employers to take on new workers if penalty rates were lowered. On ABC AM Turnbull noted the commission did not favour exempting current workers from cuts through \u201cred-circling\u201d or grandfathering but rather favours phasing in penalty rate cuts over several years. He suggested that yearly increases in award base rates of pay could offset reductions in penalty rates to some extent. \u201cWe\u2019re supportive of the commission managing this in a way that ensures that take-home pay is \u2013 as far as possible \u2013 maintained, that is the objective of modern awards.\u201d At the press conference, Turnbull said that \u201chow the commission protects low-paid workers ... in this transition is a matter for the commission\u201d. He said the government supported the objective that workers\u2019 take-home pay is protected, but \u201chow that\u2019s done\u201d \u2013 whether through take-home pay orders or phasing cuts in over time \u2013 was a matter for FWC.

      "bodyText": "The primary takeaway from Donald Trump\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress seems to be that it was remarkable, precisely for how unremarkable it was. Trump stayed on script and on message, a rare performance for the president who often digresses into ad-libs during public remarks. For this, Trump earned a fair amount of praise from media and political pundits, praise many felt was unwarranted and the product of a \u201clow bar\u201d Trump has set for himself. Media reactions A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump Trump began by condemning a wave of antisemitic threats and vandalism, as well as the racist murder of an Indian man in Kansas by a xenophobic white man, declaring that the US is \u201cunited in condemning hate and evil in all its forms\u201d. Just hours earlier, Trump had suggested the spate of bomb threats against Jewish centers might be \u201cthe reverse\u201d of what they appear, \u201cto make others look bad\u201d. Analysis of speech Democrats, including many female lawmakers dressed in all-white, offered no applause at any point during Trump\u2019s remarks, even for bipartisan proposals and lines. Only one Democrat, West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin, stood and applauded Trump with any frequency. The partisan divide Trump outlined a bit of what has been a characteristically vague plan to replace the Affordable Care Act in last night\u2019s address. The most important provision Trump supported was \u201ctax credits\u201d for obtaining private coverage. Similar to the current system of subsidies, Republicans want them to be less generous, and to distribute them by age \u2013 not income. What it all means More than 60 law enforcement heads have appealed to the White House against a push to enlist police officers in the highly contentious job of deporting undocumented immigrants. In a joint letter, the chiefs objected to being thrust into \u201cnew and sometimes problematic tasks\u201d that will \u201charm locally based, community-oriented policing\u201d. Read more The rights to Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s forthcoming memoirs were acquired by Penguin Random House at auction for a price believed to be in excess of $60m. The former president has sold more than 4m copies of his three books already, and it\u2019s likely that number will skyrocket when his yet-to-be-written post-presidency manuscript hits shelves.",

      "bodyText": "All Sergio Ag\u00fcero can do is keep offering the kind of performance that was essential to this victory over Huddersfield Town. The Argentinian scored twice to follow the two he registered against Monaco in Manchester City\u2019s previous outing. The display was capped by him pressing furiously just before being replaced towards the end. This caused enthusiastic applause from his manager, Pep Guardiola, who had previously dropped Ag\u00fcero and who might have preferred Gabriel Jesus for this replay but for the Brazilian\u2019s metatarsal injury. Yet, following this canter into the FA Cup quarter-finals, the Catalan showered him with praise. \u201cIt\u2019s the best Sergio Ag\u00fcero ever. The performance was amazing,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThe runs were at the right moment and the right tempo. It is the best performance I\u2019ve ever seen from Sergio in many things. He is good with the ball, one against one, two against one.

The last time Manchester City played, on-lookers wound up gibbering like eejits as they tried to explain the fun, as Pep Guardiola\u2019s hot-fangled troupe exchanged digs and slips with Monaco. And the time City played before that, they served up a belting match with Huddersfield. How belting? About as belting as 0-0\u2019s get, that\u2019s how belting. It was almost freakish that there were no goals in that game and it\u2019s highly unlikely that today\u2019s encounter will remain scoreless \u2013 mind you, David Wagner has had his side practising penalties just in case the teams remain inseparable by the end of extra-time. </p> <p>That suggests that Wagner, although he will rotate his team, is deadset on advancing to an FA quarter-final bout with Middlesbrough despite the fact that Huddersfield already have a humungous promotion challenge on their plates and a high-stakes Championship bout with Newcastle United this weekend. Wagner, then, just loves winning (and sometimes struggles to contain his celebrations, which is why he\u2019s banned from the dugout today) and wants to add to Huddersfield solitary victory in the FA Cup final, which came way back in 1922, when Huddersfield\u2019s goalkeeper famously wore glasses and the referee famously didn\u2019t, Huddersfield\u2019s winning goal coming from a penalty awarded for a foul that took place outside the box. Pretty sure that\u2019s when the use of video technology was first mooted. </p> <p>We can expect City to be hellbent on victory, too, and they may even field a full-strength side, as they come into this game on the back of a couple of weeks off and are only playing Sunderland this weekend. During their break they swung over to Dubai, where Guardiola had a natter with the club\u2019s owners, where discussions presumably included summer transfer targets and the urgent need to find a goalkeeper with flawless heading skills. It wouldn\u2019t help the manager\u2019s cause if his first match after that chat was a defeat to lower-league opposition. Or maybe it would. </p> <p>All in all, this has the makings of an entertaining show. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T18:50:57.041Z\">at 6.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b6aefae4b07c254ae210fb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T11:24:29.384Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Teams</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>City</strong>: Bravo; Zabaleta, Stones, Otamendi, Clichy; Fernandinho; San\u00e9, De Bruyne, Garcia, Sterling; Aguero</p> <p><em><strong> Subs</strong>: Cabellero, Sagna, Fernando, Navas, Delph, Silva, Iheanacho</em></p> <p><strong> Huddersfield</strong>: Coleman; Cranie, Hudson, Stankovic, Holmes-Dennis; Billing, Whitehead, Lolley, Payne; Bunn, Quaner</p> <p><em><strong> Subs</strong>: Ward, Smith, Hogg, Kachunga, Van La Parra, Wells, Hefele</em></p> <p><strong> Referee</strong>: P Tierney</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/feb/28/pep-guardiola-joe-hart-manchester-city-exit\">Pep Guardiola comments move Joe Hart closer to Manchester City exit</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T19:17:26.048Z\">at 7.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That was a highly entertaining duel from which both sides emerge with credit. City were deserving winners and produced some sparkling attacking play because Huddersfield forced them to. Tanking achieved! It came via a fine flowing move, started by Fernandinho - and finished by Iheanacho from an offside position. 87 min: Quander blems one over from 10 yards after the ball broke to him in the box! 86 min: \u201cBe fair,\u201d storms Jason. \u201c\u201dI didn\u2019t merely predict a City win, I predicted a tanking (which it now surely is) and implied that Huddersfield should\u2019ve have practiced more real-game-scenarios (i.e. defending) rather than kicks from the penalty spot.\u201d It\u2019s hardly a zero-sum scenario, though, is it?

They\u2019re a proper team, as even their second-string has given City a better game than several Premier League side have done this season. 84 min: Sterling skins his man down the right this time, then steadies himself and fizzes a low pass in to Iheanacho in the box. The Nigerian holds it up well with his back to goal and then plays a cute return ball to Sterling, who had zipped in from the wing to fire a shot at goal. Blocked by Coleman. 82 min: Huddersfield are beaten now, and pretty much bowed. It\u2019s just about avoiding the concession of another goal now. City substitution: Navas on, San\u00e9 off. \u201cReferring to De Bruyne a Flying Dutchman?\u201d blurts Peter Oh. \u201cDid I miss something? Is this just an honest mistake, or just part and parcel of the post-truth world? Not only is De Bruyne not a Dutchman, he also bears an uncanny resemblance to his famous countryman, the Belgian cartoon adventurer Tintin!\u201d It wasn\u2019t me, Peter, it was one of your fellow emailers, whose name I can\u2019t be bothered to go back and check. Let\u2019s call him Cuthbert, as in Calculus. City substitution: Iheanacho on, Aguero off. 78 min: Sterling slips on a pair of jetboots to skedaddle to the bye-line and reach a seemingly unreachable pass. He then clips the ball towards the near post ... where no one is awaiting it, because no one thought Sterling would be in any position to deliver a pass. 76 min: City are insatiable. They want to trample their visitors into the ground. Thoroughly admirable bloodlust. City substitution: Delph on, De Bruyne off. Now that\u2019s what you can all a like-for-like change. City are safe now! Fernandinho helped a cross-field pass on to De Bruyne, who flipped it wide to Sterling on the left. He pinged in a fine low cross, and Aguero did the rest, sweeping the ball into the net from eight yards. 72 min: Van La Parra makes a strong run down the left and then whacks in a low cross. Smith can\u2019t get on the end of it, however. 70 min: It\u2019s a tribute to how well Huddersfield\u2019s B team have played that Guardiola has not yet felt safe enough to make any substitutions. Huddersfield substitution: Hogg on, the splendid Billing off. 66 min: A splendid, cutting ball from midfield by De Bruyne. Sterling races around the blind side of Holmes-Dennis to try to get on the end of it, and appears to be shoved by the defender. Move along, nothing to see here, gestures the ref. 64 min: \u201cAm I too late to ask how The Flying Belgian is doing this evening?\u201d asks Rob. No, I think we can answer that within the remaining 26 minutes. Here goes: De Bruyne is playing well. Pulling City\u2019s strings from a central position. 62 min: De Bruyne curls a freekick over the wall from 25 yards. Easy save for Coleman. Hudddersfield substitution: Smith on, Lolley off. \u201cBe nice to think that somewhere on the field a Huddersfield player with a finely tuned sense of historical perspective, is whispering in a Mancunian ear \u2018You\u2019ll never win three titles in a row though,\u2019 chortles Ian Forth. 56 min: Cranie sends a long ball over the top for Quaner to chase. The striker does exactly that, and wins the race before veering into the City\u2019s box. As he cuts past Stones the defender catches his foot, sending Quander tumbling to the grass. Penalty? No! Not according to the ref. A case of the forward running into the defender\u2019s foot, rather than an overt foul. 54 min: After Huddersfield take a short corner, Quaner curls in a low cross. Lolley meets it at the edge of the six-yards box. What a chance! But he nods wide and then puts hits hand to his mouth, presumably to conceal profuse swearing. Profuse swearing being the only sensible reaction to a miss like that. Huddersfield substitution: Van La Parra on, Bunn off. 51 min: Quaner robs De Bruyne in midfield and then bounds forward. He tricks his way past one defender and then tries his luck from 20 yards. It deflects over the bar for a corner. 49 min: Quaner, who\u2019s pretty elusive for a giant, skips past Stones before being illegally felled. Thats a freekick to Huddersfield wide on the left. They float it into the box but Stones nods away, Otamendi clears it farther, all the way to Aguero on half-way. The Argentinian races deep into Huddersfield territory before slipping a nice pass through to San\u00e9, who looks sets to scamper into the box and let fly with a shot ... until he over-runs the ball. He\u2019s been mostly brilliant today, San\u00e9, but that\u2019s the second time he\u2019s lost control of the ball when in an excellent position. Youthful exuberance, I guess. 47 min: Tricky interplay by Huddersfield down the left ends up with them winning a throw-in near the City corner flag on the left. From there they produce yet more fine play ... until Holmes-Dennis wanders offside. 46 min: Off we go again. \u201cI\u2019m checking in from time to time,\u201d announces Jason [see chat before kick-off]. \u201cThat blitz by City has me looking PRETTY smart right about now.\u201d Yep, you were pretty smart to predict a City win and suggest Huddersfield were prats for thinking they could compete. Speaking of works of art, check this out. I\u2019ve just been admiring a replay of the San\u00e9 shot that hit the post in the opening minutes. It was a sumptuous effort, not entirely dissimilar to Nelinho\u2019s unmatchable oeuvre: Huddersfield\u2019s second-string have been pretty good, but City have been better. Given their movement, skill and precision, the hosts look set to run away with this unless Huddersfield can do something special in the second half. 43 min: Excellent through-ball by Billing to Payne, who suddenly finds himself one-on-one with Bravo. He tries to curl a low left-footer into the far corner ... but he got his angles wrong and rolls it at Bravo. Who saved! 40 min: Coleman hares out of his area to head a ball clear. Meanwhile, Lolley and Fernandinho are lying on the ground at the other end of the pitch after hurting each other in a legitimate challenge for the ball. There\u2019ll be a break in play while they receive treatment and Huddersfield try to come up with a way of turning the tide that is in danger of completely overwhelming them now. City have moved into overdrive and Huddersfield can\u2019t handle them. Coleman saved Aguero\u2019s first shot but the Argentinian retrieved the ball near the bye-line and played a simple pass to his compatriot at the near post. Zabaleta swept it gratefully into the net from close range. 37 min: Cranie is hassled by Clichy into losing possession in the right-back area. The balls pops out to Aguero, who scurries into the box and sends a low sidefooted shot past the keeper. But it bounces out of the same post that San\u00e9 hit earlier! Coleman goes one way, Aguero slots it the other way. Stankovic is ruled to have pushed over Otamendi as he tried to connect with a cross from Zabaleta. Lovely goal. De Bruyne spanked a long pass from the left over to Sterling on the far side. Homes-Dennis clips it with his hand - inexplicably, and inexplicably missed by the ref - but that doesn\u2019t matter, because Sterling collected it, flashed several lollipops to Holmes-Dennis and then laced in a lovely low cross that San\u00e9 tapped home from two yards. 28 min: Huddersfield have enjoyed a spell of play in the City half. They really are pesky opponents and City are not enjoying the experience of playing them even though they have created several chances. \u201cWhy has Pep got one of those coats that you wear so you don\u2019t have to pay for a bag on Ryanair?\u201d wonders Ian. 25 min: San\u00e9 starts a searing run deep in his own half and leaves defenders floundering in his wake. As he races towards the box a whole range of possibilities open up for him - he could play in either Aguero or De Bruyne or try to continue his dribble himself - but as he tried to make up his mind he over-ran the ball, enabling Cranie to nick it off him and clear the danger. 23 min: Huddersfield have barely been outside their half in the last seven or eight minutes, and they\u2019re using a hell of a lot of energy as they try to keep City at bay. This match is far from done. \u201cThat Wagner has his team running Rings round City,\u201d offers William Hargreaves. \u201cHe Tristans them on the counter, when Bunn sees Bravo Isolde dummy to score.\u201d If there are any more of these high-brow Wagner puns, I\u2019m going to ask someone to have a word with you. A real Hart to Hart conversation. 20 min: The pressure is building from City, to the point that Huddersfield are reeling. Cranie has just made a last-ditch block from a shot by Fernandinho. The result is a corner but City players are complaining that they should have had a penalty for another handball. 17 min: City are gifted a chance by a slack pass in midfield. They work it quickly to De Bruyne, who scampers into the box and then uses a sly feint to send one defender sliding away in vain. Then, from six yards out, he does the same again, and this time the ball hits the hand of the sliding defender. City appeal for a penalty by the referee rules that the handball was accidental. 15 min: De Bruyne fires a wobbly freekick over the wall. Coleman stops it, drops it, and then picks it up. Danger over. 14 min: Freekick to City because Hudson pulled down Aguero to stop him connecting with a return pass from Sterling. A yellow card, too, for the veteran defender. And a shooting chance for De Bruyne, from about 25 yards and a little to the left. 11 min: Huddersfield\u2019s vivacity is annoying City, who are starting to mislay passes under pressure. 8 min: City started very strongly, plainly keen to put the underdogs in their place early doors. But that goal has shocked them and they\u2019ve lost a little of their swagger. They\u2019re certainly not panicking, however, just trying to knock the ball around a bit to compose their thoughts. 6 min: Wagner punches the air in the stands while thousands of Terriers fans go even wilder in another part of the ground - all celebrating a lovely goal by their team. After they swept down the on the counter-attack, Billing helped the ball through to Bunn with a subtle flick. Bunn took a touch and fired a low shot under Bravo and into the net! That seems to be Bravo\u2019s weakness: shots on target. Moments after Aguero forces a save at the other end, Huddersfield take the lead with a well-worked counter-attack! 4 min: A tremendous attack by CIty concludes with a brilliant shot by San\u00e9. He received a pass by De Bruyne near the left-hand corner of the Huddersfield box and immediately cracked a viciously swerving shot with the outside of his foot past the keeper ... and out off the far post! 2 min: Already it is clear that, to no one\u2019s surprise, Huddersfield intend pressing vigorously. They don\u2019t plan to let City have tie on the ball anywhere on the pitch, and that seems a shrewd policy with Stones and Otamendi manning the opposition\u2019s defence. 1 min: Off we go. Huddersfield survive the first minute without City having so much as a shot. Are you watching, Jason? The players are where they need to be. City are dressed in sky blue kit with the now-familiar darker blue shoulder cladding. Huddersfield are in black and luminous lime stripes, a homage to Wagner\u2019s Dortmund roots. Pep has also been quizzed by the BBC and he wasn\u2019t impressed by any of the questions so provided answers that I\u2019ve already forgotten. Sorry about that. David Wagner has just been speaking to the BBC. Asked whether his team can win today, he replied: \u201cYes, why not? Everybody knows we are the underdog and we have to get a lot of details right but we showed in the first game that we can make things hard for City.\u201d As for his team\u2019s approach, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s the Cup so it\u2019s live or die - and we\u2019d like to live. It\u2019s a great occasion \u2013 the oldest competition in the world - and we\u2019re still in it, so go out with freedom and be brave.\u201d CIty fans might be interested to note that Monaco are also in Cup action today (at Marseille) and, unlike City, have omitted most of their regular starters. City prepared for this match with a spot of warm-weather training no Dubai. I\u2019d like to think that Guardiola took a leaf out of David Wagner\u2019s book (as described here) and told Yaya Tour\u00e9, Sergio Aguero and the lads to share tents and hunt and cook their own food, but I guess their agents would have told us about that already if such an outrage had taken place. \u201cIn your preamble you say that David Wagner has had his side practising penalties!?\u201d snorts Jason. \u201cOn that note of hubris from Wagner, i\u2019m switching this mbm off, as Huddersfield will get tanked and won\u2019t get near a kicks-from-the-penalty-spot situation.\u201d Are you sure you\u2019re being dismissive enough, Jason? Wasn\u2019t it quite arrogant of Huddersfield to even get on the bus to Manchester? Now that the uppity sods are here, they should just sit on the sidelines and ask Pep if he\u2019ll let them watch the Premier League stars train. Wagner, by the way, has made nine alterations to the side he sent out for Huddersfield\u2019s last (contemptibly lower) league match. Which means that today\u2019s lineup is very similar to the one that had the temerity to draw with City in the first match. Hello. The last time Manchester City played, on-lookers wound up gibbering like eejits as they tried to explain the fun, as Pep Guardiola\u2019s hot-fangled troupe exchanged digs and slips with Monaco. And the time City played before that, they served up a belting match with Huddersfield. How belting? About as belting as 0-0\u2019s get, that\u2019s how belting. It was almost freakish that there were no goals in that game and it\u2019s highly unlikely that today\u2019s encounter will remain scoreless \u2013 mind you, David Wagner has had his side practising penalties just in case the teams remain inseparable by the end of extra-time. That suggests that Wagner, although he will rotate his team, is deadset on advancing to an FA quarter-final bout with Middlesbrough despite the fact that Huddersfield already have a humungous promotion challenge on their plates and a high-stakes Championship bout with Newcastle United this weekend. Wagner, then, just loves winning (and sometimes struggles to contain his celebrations, which is why he\u2019s banned from the dugout today) and wants to add to Huddersfield solitary victory in the FA Cup final, which came way back in 1922, when Huddersfield\u2019s goalkeeper famously wore glasses and the referee famously didn\u2019t, Huddersfield\u2019s winning goal coming from a penalty awarded for a foul that took place outside the box. Pretty sure that\u2019s when the use of video technology was first mooted. We can expect City to be hellbent on victory, too, and they may even field a full-strength side, as they come into this game on the back of a couple of weeks off and are only playing Sunderland this weekend. During their break they swung over to Dubai, where Guardiola had a natter with the club\u2019s owners, where discussions presumably included summer transfer targets and the urgent need to find a goalkeeper with flawless heading skills. It wouldn\u2019t help the manager\u2019s cause if his first match after that chat was a defeat to lower-league opposition. Or maybe it would. All in all, this has the makings of an entertaining show.

But despite opponents doing their best to prolong the debate, we\u2019re getting closer and closer. The recent consensus report into the government\u2019s draft marriage equality law was an unprecedented show of collaboration and showed that we can work together to finally make this reform.

If any caterers did not want to provide services, the reality would be that any of those couple\u2019s radiant smiles would melt any prejudice the caterers had. I\u2019m equally sure that there are many more cake bakers, florists and photographers who are hanging out for the extra business that marriage equality is going to bring. The Senate\u2019s consensus report now paves the way for politicians in parliament to have a free vote on marriage equality. It has been so disappointing to see a prime minister succumb to the extreme elements of his own party, but I truly believe that there are enough Coalition MPs who are willing to stand up for equality in their party room, and if required, cross the floor for this long-overdue achievement. Of everything that this Saturday\u2019s Mardi Gras will be, it will be first and foremost an expression of solidarity. We will come together to show that love is love, and that we can work together to achieve marriage equality. When Penny and I parade hand in hand with the Greens\u2019 marriage equality-themed float, we will thank those original marchers, now known as the 78ers, for paving the way for the possibility of equality. If Fred Nile\u2019s prayers are answered \u2013 as the forecast suggests it might \u2013 we will dance around in the rain. And we will look forward to a time when the sun starts shining and everyone in that crowd has the opportunity to marry the person they love.

Lastly the aircraft fired machine guns at survivors.\u201d </p> <p>The report also said there was conclusive evidence that Syrian forces had dropped toxic industrial chemicals, including chlorine on opposition communities throughout the last year, causing hundreds of casualties. It did not attribute blame on Russian forces, which \u2013 along with Iran \u2013 helped turn the tide for Assad soon after Vladimir Putin ordered Russia\u2019s intervention in September 2015.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/21/syria-aid-convoy-attack-what-evidence-claims-russia-to-blame\">Syria aid convoy attack: what evidence is there that Russia is to blame?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday, Russia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/01/russia-and-china-veto-un-resolution-to-impose-sanctions-on-syria\">used its veto for a seventh time to protect Syria from UN security council sanctions</a> over allegations of chemical weapons use throughout the six year war.

      "bodyText": "The United Nations has accused the Syrian government of deliberately attacking an aid convoy near Aleppo last September, and labeled a forced evacuation of opposition-held parts of the east of the city as a \u201cwar crime\u201d. In a report covering the capture of Aleppo by forces supporting the Syrian regime, the UN also accused Damascus of repeatedly using chemical weapons and cluster munitions, and systematically destroying hospitals. The UN commission of inquiry for Syria said war crimes were committed by both sides from July until the city fell on 22 December. However, it levelled extensive criticism at the government of Bashar al-Assad, which was strongly supported by Russian jets and Iranian-backed militias throughout the campaign. A centrepiece of the investigation was the accusation that Syrian jets had conducted a series of airstrikes on 19 September that targeted an aid convoy, which had been permitted by regime officials to deliver food and medicines to the Urum al-Kubra area west of Aleppo. The evidence strongly suggested that the attack in which 20 civilians and aid workers were killed was \u201cmeticulously planned and ruthlessly carried out\u201d, it said. The destruction of most of the convoy and the subsequent suspension of further aid deliveries served as a \u201cstarve or surrender\u201d policy pursued by the regime in east Aleppo and other opposition-held areas of Syria. A previous UN inquiry found that it could not determine who had carried out the airstrike, which came amid widespread international pressure for aid to be allowed into rebel-held areas. However, the new report laid the blame squarely at the feet of the Syrian regime, detailing three phases of attacks, the first of which involved barrel bombs \u2013 a weapon not deployed by the Russian air force. \u201cFirst helicopters dropped barrel bombs, which struck the warehouse and a family home nearby,\u201d the report said, citing testimonies from some of the 291 people interviewed by the UN inquiry team. Scientific evidence and satellite imagery supported the findings. \u201cSubsequently, planes, described by several witnesses as Sukhoi jets, carried out attacks, killing several aid workers. Lastly the aircraft fired machine guns at survivors.\u201d The report also said there was conclusive evidence that Syrian forces had dropped toxic industrial chemicals, including chlorine on opposition communities throughout the last year, causing hundreds of casualties. It did not attribute blame on Russian forces, which \u2013 along with Iran \u2013 helped turn the tide for Assad soon after Vladimir Putin ordered Russia\u2019s intervention in September 2015. On Tuesday, Russia used its veto for a seventh time to protect Syria from UN security council sanctions over allegations of chemical weapons use throughout the six year war. Syrian forces have repeatedly been accused of using chemical weapons \u2013 including sarin, the nerve agent that killed an estimated 1,300 people in the opposition-held area of Ghouta, near Damascus, in August 2013. Western intelligence officials believe that sarin was again used last December in the eastern Hama region \u2013 an area held by Isis, which days earlier had seized the historic city of Palmyra for a second time. At least 92 people were killed and about 300 left incapacitated by airstrikes in five small villages, medical organisations confirmed. However, unlike the attacks near Damascus, intelligence agencies were unable to retrieve biological samples, from either the blood of victims or contaminated soil. Vladimir Safronov, the deputy Russian envoy to the UN, said Moscow was sceptical of the results of a joint investigation \u2013 in which it had participated \u2013 which found that Syrian government forces had carried out at least three chlorine gas attacks. It also found that Isis had been responsible for at least one attack involving mustard gas. The UN report also detailed the systematic destruction of healthcare facilities in east Aleppo. It found that no hospitals were functioning there at the time the last residents fled. During the recapture of rebel-held parts of the city, pro-regime forces had arrested doctors and aid workers and committed reprisal executions, the report claimed. The report claimed the regime and the opposition had each committed war crimes by forcing the evacuation of the city for \u201cstrategic reasons\u201d and \u201cnot for the security of civilians, or imperative military necessity\u201d. The report concluded that the Aleppo evacuation agreement (which was overseen by the International Committee of the Red Cross) amounted to the \u201cwar crime of forced displacement\u201d.

Rebel groups had also prevented some civilians from fleeing east Aleppo, used some communities as \u201chuman shields\u201d and attacked a Kurdish neighbourhood.",

Which is basically it\u2019s just another way of describing a La Liga title race. As ever, it\u2019s turning childish. Gerard Pique has been doing some investigating on the internet, an activity which never ends well, and took to Twitter after a controversial penalty helped Real Madrid beat Villarreal to point out that Barcelona\u2019s title rivals have been getting a helping hand from Spain\u2019s Howard Webbs. The Barcelona defender even backed up his argument by handpicking examples from the Madrid press, so before you say it he\u2019s not biased okay, he\u2019s just concerned about justice and fair play and anyway IT\u2019S ABOUT TIME YOU WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE, SHEEPLE, IT\u2019S HAPPENING RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES. Madrid weren\u2019t amused by Pique\u2019s Twitter shenanigans, however. Sergio Ramos and Zinedine Zidane have muttered something about FAKE NEWS!!!!!!! in response. Ramos and Pique are Spain\u2019s central defenders, so that\u2019s nice.</p> <p>Grown men, this lot. Extremely talented grown men, mind you. Because while they\u2019re making a sorry show of themselves off the pitch, where it\u2019s all about to kick off, it\u2019s hotting up on it. A few weeks ago, it didn\u2019t look like there was going to be much of a title race in Spain. Barcelona were reeling from their Champions League pasting in Paris and needed a last-minute penalty from a grumpy Leo Messi to beat Leganes at Camp Nou 10 days ago. </p> <p>But it\u2019s opened up in the past week. Last Wednesday, Madrid lost one of their spare games, going down 2-1 in a thrilling encounter with Valencia, and Barcelona briefly went top on Sunday after Messi\u2019s late winner against Atletico Madrid. Sevilla, widely held to be the best team in Spain at the moment, stayed in the hunt with a win over Real Betis that allowed them to dream of their first title since 1946 and a frenetic day ended with Madrid fighting back from 2-0 down against Villarreal. Madrid are a point clear of Barcelona, while Sevilla are three points off the pace. Barcelona can keep the pressure on with a win over Sporting Gijon at Camp Nou, though. The visitors are 18th and have conceded 11 in their past two matches against the champions, so you\u2019d think there\u2019ll be no need for Pique to fire up his social media accounts later.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 6.30pm in London, 7.30pm in Barcelona.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T17:40:50.668Z\">at 5.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "A comfortable win for Barcelona, Leo Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar all on the scoresheet. They go top, but for how long? Real Madrid are in action now against Las Palmas. Thanks for reading. Bye. 90 min: Two minutes of the added stuff. With everyone getting a little bit bored, Ivan Rakitic decides to score. He combines with Sergi Roberto on the right, receiving the ball back from the youngster, flicking it in the air and lashing a venomous shot high past Cuellar from close range. 85 min: Barcelona are playing out time here. 81 min: Jordi Alba curls against the post, but the flag\u2019s up for offside. Just as well he didn\u2019t score: he was onside. 80 min: A loose ball drops to Neymar on the left, but he blazes miles wide. 78 min: Rakitic plays a one-two with Alcacer and shoots low and accurately from 20 yards. Cuellar just tips it wide. 77 min: This game has been over as a contest since the first whistle tenth minute. Sporting\u2019s minds are elsewhere. 74 min: Sergi Roberto replaces Rafinha. 72 min: Neymar bounces a curler straight at Cuellar from the left. 70 min: As it stands, and it\u2019s probably not going to change, Barcelona are going top. Real Madrid kick off against Las Palmas soon. Neymar finally has the goal he deserves and it\u2019s a brilliant one. A free-kick to Barcelona, a few yards to the right of the D. It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s made for a right footer. So you\u2019d have to think. But Neymar whips it viciously over the wall and high inside the near post. Woof! He\u2019s pleased with himself. 61 min: Andre Gomes replaces Leo Messi, who\u2019s earned a rest. 60 min: Isma Lopez replaces Burgui. 59 min: Messi audaciously goes for an unorthodox, casually dinked effort with his left foot. It floats an inch over. 58 min: Victor Rodriguez chops Denis Suarez down on the edge of the Sporting area. Messi fancies it. 55 min: Juan Rodriguez, enraged by Neymar\u2019s skills on the left, boots the Brazilian up the backside well after the ball\u2019s gone. Yellow card. 53 min: Neymar, desperate a for a goal, desperately slashes high and wide from the left of the area. 51 min: Messi tries to place one into the left corner. It\u2019s deflected wide. Babin cuts out a pass through to Messi, but then he dawdles on it. Messi ruthlessly picks his pocket and pops it to his left for Paco Alcacer, who hammers a firm shot into the left corner with his left foot. 48 min: The problem with having players like Messi, Suarez and Neymar - if there is a problem with having players like Messi, Suarez and Neymar - is the lack of opportunities it affords players like Paco Alcacer. How do you keep your squad hungry and happy? 46 min: Barcelona get the second half underway. Paco Alcacer has replaced Luis Suarez. Victor Rodriguez is on for Douglas. See you in 15 minutes. 45 min+1: Neymar picks up a booking for dissent. 43 min: Straight up the other end, Neymar motors away down the left after a Sporting mistake breaks down and Lillo presents him with the ball with a poor header. Neymar speeds into the area, opens up his body and aims for the far corner, only for Cuellar to save with his feet. Rafinha can\u2019t do anything with the rebound. 42 min: Burgui cuts inside and lets fly with his right foot. Ter Stegen pushes it aside and Alba reacts quickly to deny Castro another tap-in. 39 min: \u201cIt\u2019s odd about Busquets,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cHe\u2019s looked well off his feed recently - the other day he misplaced three passes in succession - and you\u2019d say he was just getting old. But he\u2019s what, 28, 29? Barcelona can hardly afford him not come back to the boil, given the patchiness of Rafinha and Rakitic (leaving aside Andre Gomes\u2019s entertainingly spectacular badness).\u201d 38 min: Suarez rams a shot straight at Cuellar from long range. 36 min: Burgui politely asks the referee whether Javier Mascherano\u2019s just handled in the Barcelona area. There\u2019s no controversy here. It hit Mascherano on the chest. 33 min: A replay of Barcelona\u2019s second goal confirms that it was an own-goal. So Luis Suarez is two away from his hat-trick. 30 min: Possession update: Barcelona 71-29 Sporting Gijon. 29 min: Messi picks out Neymar\u2019s run on the left, but the Brazilian\u2019s stretching as he makes contact with the ball and can\u2019t set up Suarez for a simple tap-in. If there was doubt over Luis Suarez\u2019s first goal, there\u2019s none over this one A poor clearing header from Babin drops to Suarez, who watches the ball from the air and sets himself perfectly before larrumping a vicious volley past the helpless Cuellar. Wow. 25 min: Messi combines with Suarez, whose sees a low shot deflected behind for a corner. From Neymar\u2019s corner, Rakitic has a free header, but it\u2019s blocked and eventually cleared. 24 min: Burgui picks up a booking for bringing down Messi from behind. Dramatic tension: back! Burgui spots Sergio Alvarez peeling away from Sergio Busquets and releases him behind the Barcelona defence on the left. Through on goal, the midfielder pokes past Ter Stegen with the outside of his right foot. In slow motion, the ball rolls against the left post and Castro taps in the rebound. 21 min: Messi opens Sporting up with a superb scooped pass with the outside of his left foot on the edge of the area, but Rafinha\u2019s first touch is a tad heavy, forcing him to slash wide with his second from close range. 18 min: Dramatic tension: non-existent. 17 min: Looking at the replays of the second goal, it might go down as a Juan Rodriguez own goal. It\u2019s not clear that Suarez\u2019s shot was heading on target. 15 min: \u201cI used to read FourFourTwo but am wondering if I\u2019m behind the times and should look for more cutting-edge, hip reading such as FourThreeThree or ThreeFourThree,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cMy guess is that every issue of the latter has Antonio Conte\u2019s mug on the cover.\u201d 13 min: Neymar lollops forward, skipping down the left and putting the fear of God into the Sporting defence. But his shot\u2019s blocked. In a seemingly harmless position on the left, Neymar reminds us that harm\u2019s always possible when he\u2019s on the ball. He slices Sporting open with a glorious inswinging pass through to Suarez, who rounds Cuellar and squeezes the ball goalwards from a tight angle on the left. The covering Juan Rodriguez only succeeds in pushing the ball over the line and this is going to get ugly. Javier Mascherano spots Lionel Messi\u2019s run from deep and lofts a pass over the Sporting defence. Messi\u2019s played miles onside by Lillo, despite the protests from the visitors, and the flag stays down, allowing the little genius to loop a header over the advancing Cuellar and into the empty net. That didn\u2019t take long. 6 min: Barcelona have the ball. Sporting have retreated into an expansive 9-0-0-0-0-0-1 system. 4 min: Maybe it\u2019s a 3-4-3. Ah, it\u2019s all just numbers in the end. 3 min: Rafinha, a midfielder by trade, might not have to defend too much tonight. Here\u2019s Barcelona\u2019s first attack. Messi finds Rafinha on the right and the youngster shifts the ball on to his left foot before sending a hopeful curler just wide of the far post. 2 min: Barcelona have lined up in a 4-3-3, after all, with Rafinha at right-back. Oh for a Dani Alves. Or Dani Alves. And we\u2019re off! Sporting Gijon, in red and white stripes, get the game underway. They\u2019re kicking from right to left in the first half. Here come the teams. Sporting Gijon\u2019s punishment The match is about to begin. The signs are that Barcelona are playing a 3-4-3 again. How very Conte. It worked, sort of, against Atletico Madrid on Sunday and seems to have taken some of the pressure off Sergio Busquets, who had been struggling badly in the hallowed 4-3-3 system. Barcelona: Ter Stegen; Umtiti, Mascherano, Alba; Busquets, Rafinha, Denis, Rakitic; Messi, Luis Suarez, Neymar. Subs: Cillessen, Pique, Iniesta, Paco Alc\u00e1cer, Digne, Sergi Roberto, Andr\u00e9 Gomes. Sporting Gijon: Cuellar; Lillo, Babin, Juan Rodriguez, Echiejile; Torres; Douglas, Cases, Sergio Alvarez, Burgui; Castro. Subs: Marino, Vesga, Lora, Lopez, Victor, Traore, Duje Cop. Hello. Put on your tin foil hat, crush your smartphone to smithereens and read up on MSM bias, because it\u2019s conspiracy time! Which is basically it\u2019s just another way of describing a La Liga title race. As ever, it\u2019s turning childish. Gerard Pique has been doing some investigating on the internet, an activity which never ends well, and took to Twitter after a controversial penalty helped Real Madrid beat Villarreal to point out that Barcelona\u2019s title rivals have been getting a helping hand from Spain\u2019s Howard Webbs. The Barcelona defender even backed up his argument by handpicking examples from the Madrid press, so before you say it he\u2019s not biased okay, he\u2019s just concerned about justice and fair play and anyway IT\u2019S ABOUT TIME YOU WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE, SHEEPLE, IT\u2019S HAPPENING RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES. Madrid weren\u2019t amused by Pique\u2019s Twitter shenanigans, however. Sergio Ramos and Zinedine Zidane have muttered something about FAKE NEWS!!!!!!! in response. Ramos and Pique are Spain\u2019s central defenders, so that\u2019s nice. Grown men, this lot. Extremely talented grown men, mind you. Because while they\u2019re making a sorry show of themselves off the pitch, where it\u2019s all about to kick off, it\u2019s hotting up on it. A few weeks ago, it didn\u2019t look like there was going to be much of a title race in Spain. Barcelona were reeling from their Champions League pasting in Paris and needed a last-minute penalty from a grumpy Leo Messi to beat Leganes at Camp Nou 10 days ago. But it\u2019s opened up in the past week. Last Wednesday, Madrid lost one of their spare games, going down 2-1 in a thrilling encounter with Valencia, and Barcelona briefly went top on Sunday after Messi\u2019s late winner against Atletico Madrid. Sevilla, widely held to be the best team in Spain at the moment, stayed in the hunt with a win over Real Betis that allowed them to dream of their first title since 1946 and a frenetic day ended with Madrid fighting back from 2-0 down against Villarreal. Madrid are a point clear of Barcelona, while Sevilla are three points off the pace. Barcelona can keep the pressure on with a win over Sporting Gijon at Camp Nou, though. The visitors are 18th and have conceded 11 in their past two matches against the champions, so you\u2019d think there\u2019ll be no need for Pique to fire up his social media accounts later. Kick-off: 6.30pm in London, 7.30pm in Barcelona.",

      "body": "<p>It may be stretching things to suggest March 2017 witnessed the onset of golf\u2019s great revolution, but the sport is in the midst of fascinating times. Final preparations for the first World Golf Championship of the year, the biggest golf event to take place in Mexico, were partly overshadowed by proposals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/01/golf-world-championships-news-siginificant-rule-changes-proposed\" title=\"\">to overhaul the rules of the game</a> to an extent not witnessed in 100 years.</p> <p>The changes include less time allowed for ball searches, the banning of caddies lining players up, permission to use clubs damaged during a round and no sanction for accidentally moving a ball or a marker. The overriding motivations are to speed up play and make golf more simple, and the alterations are more radical than many had predicted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/feb/15/innovation-and-open-minds-will-be-needed-to-bring-golf-to-wider-audience\">If golf really wants innovation, how about a second cut for Saturday? | Ewan Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOur aim is to make the rules easier to understand and to apply for all golfers,\u201d said the R&amp;A\u2019s David Rickman. \u201cWe have looked at every rule to try to find ways to make them more intuitive and straightforward.\u201d</p> <p>Tiger Woods was among those to approve. \u201cGreat work to benefit the game,\u201d said the 14-times major champion. As if to prove golf is not yet a fully 21st-century commodity, none of the proposals will be implemented before 2019. Given no equipment alterations will be needed, this seems an unnecessary delay.</p> <p>Competitive intrigue at the Club de Golf Chapultepec is straightforward. Forty-nine of the world\u2019s top 50 will compete from Thursday morning, with Jason Day the only absentee, through illness. Rory McIlroy will make his first start in seven weeks in the company of Dustin Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama. Johnson revealed on Wednesday how Mexico\u2019s altitude means a 15% increase on his shot distances, with pitching wedges flying as far as 180 yards.</p> <p>McIlroy wants to keep the Masters at the back of his mind but the feeling prevails that this event also marks the starting point to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/10/jordan-spieth-rory-mcilroy-masters\" title=\"\">his latest run at a career grand slam</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, I haven\u2019t thought much about Augusta,\u201d said McIlroy, who is still wearing strapping to protect a damaged rib. \u201cMy biggest concern has just been getting healthy and being able to get back here. That\u2019s what I was thinking about.</p> <p>\u201cThe routine was get up early in the morning, do my rehab stuff, try to get out and see what I could do on the golf course, get back, have some treatment, do a few more exercises. It was just basically that on repeat for the last three or four weeks so that\u2019s all I\u2019ve really been concentrating on.</p> <p>\u201cI would say my focus was on just trying to get ready for this event and play here. I think it\u2019s nice I get to play four rounds, see where my game is, take the week off next week, reassess, how does my body feel, how does my game feel. From there I can start to think about the Masters and what I really need to do to get ready for Augusta.\u201d</p> <p>The Mexican venue is a break from the norm and a complete contrast to Doral, where the first WGC of the year was previously held. Tight, tree-lined fairways lead into small greens. Strategy is key. As one caddie remarked on Wednesday morning: \u201cIt is nice to have a few things to think about for once.\u201d</p> <p>On face value, this type of test plays perfectly into the hands of Jordan Spieth. The Texan has slipped to No6 in the world but has a recent victory on his CV, at Pebble Beach in early February. Like McIlroy, Spieth is hardly lacking in early-season motivation; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/11/jordan-spieth-loses-masters-amen-corner\" title=\"\">his collapse at the 2016 Masters</a> remains a wounding reference point.</p> <p>\u201cI think this is a good golf course for me,\u201d said Spieth. \u201cWho has best control from really 100 to about 150 yards is really, really important out here.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately I\u2019m looking to gain some momentum as we lead into the Masters. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better start to the year thus far. My putter has heated up for two days out of all the rounds I\u2019ve played this year, so if we get that going [for four]? My greens in regulation are as good as they\u2019ve ever been so I feel pretty good about things.</p> <p>\u201cDo I think about Augusta more and more? I think so as we get closer. If the US Open was the first major of the year, then I would think about that.\u201d</p> <h2>Rule changes</h2> <p><strong>The rule change proposals means there will no longer a penalty for:</strong></p> <p>Accidentally moving your ball while searching for it.</p> <p>Accidentally moving your ball or ball-marker when it is on the green.</p> <p>Your ball hitting you, your equipment, your caddie, someone attending the flagstick or a removed or attended flagstick.</p> <p>Touching your line of putt or touching the putting green in pointing out target.

      "bodyText": "It may be stretching things to suggest March 2017 witnessed the onset of golf\u2019s great revolution, but the sport is in the midst of fascinating times. Final preparations for the first World Golf Championship of the year, the biggest golf event to take place in Mexico, were partly overshadowed by proposals to overhaul the rules of the game to an extent not witnessed in 100 years. The changes include less time allowed for ball searches, the banning of caddies lining players up, permission to use clubs damaged during a round and no sanction for accidentally moving a ball or a marker. The overriding motivations are to speed up play and make golf more simple, and the alterations are more radical than many had predicted. \u201cOur aim is to make the rules easier to understand and to apply for all golfers,\u201d said the R&amp;A\u2019s David Rickman. \u201cWe have looked at every rule to try to find ways to make them more intuitive and straightforward.\u201d Tiger Woods was among those to approve. \u201cGreat work to benefit the game,\u201d said the 14-times major champion. As if to prove golf is not yet a fully 21st-century commodity, none of the proposals will be implemented before 2019. Given no equipment alterations will be needed, this seems an unnecessary delay. Competitive intrigue at the Club de Golf Chapultepec is straightforward. Forty-nine of the world\u2019s top 50 will compete from Thursday morning, with Jason Day the only absentee, through illness. Rory McIlroy will make his first start in seven weeks in the company of Dustin Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama. Johnson revealed on Wednesday how Mexico\u2019s altitude means a 15% increase on his shot distances, with pitching wedges flying as far as 180 yards. McIlroy wants to keep the Masters at the back of his mind but the feeling prevails that this event also marks the starting point to his latest run at a career grand slam. \u201cHonestly, I haven\u2019t thought much about Augusta,\u201d said McIlroy, who is still wearing strapping to protect a damaged rib. \u201cMy biggest concern has just been getting healthy and being able to get back here. That\u2019s what I was thinking about. \u201cThe routine was get up early in the morning, do my rehab stuff, try to get out and see what I could do on the golf course, get back, have some treatment, do a few more exercises. It was just basically that on repeat for the last three or four weeks so that\u2019s all I\u2019ve really been concentrating on. \u201cI would say my focus was on just trying to get ready for this event and play here. I think it\u2019s nice I get to play four rounds, see where my game is, take the week off next week, reassess, how does my body feel, how does my game feel. From there I can start to think about the Masters and what I really need to do to get ready for Augusta.\u201d The Mexican venue is a break from the norm and a complete contrast to Doral, where the first WGC of the year was previously held. Tight, tree-lined fairways lead into small greens. Strategy is key. As one caddie remarked on Wednesday morning: \u201cIt is nice to have a few things to think about for once.\u201d On face value, this type of test plays perfectly into the hands of Jordan Spieth. The Texan has slipped to No6 in the world but has a recent victory on his CV, at Pebble Beach in early February. Like McIlroy, Spieth is hardly lacking in early-season motivation; his collapse at the 2016 Masters remains a wounding reference point. \u201cI think this is a good golf course for me,\u201d said Spieth. \u201cWho has best control from really 100 to about 150 yards is really, really important out here. \u201cUltimately I\u2019m looking to gain some momentum as we lead into the Masters. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better start to the year thus far. My putter has heated up for two days out of all the rounds I\u2019ve played this year, so if we get that going [for four]? My greens in regulation are as good as they\u2019ve ever been so I feel pretty good about things. \u201cDo I think about Augusta more and more? I think so as we get closer. If the US Open was the first major of the year, then I would think about that.\u201d Rule changes The rule change proposals means there will no longer a penalty for: Accidentally moving your ball while searching for it. Accidentally moving your ball or ball-marker when it is on the green. Your ball hitting you, your equipment, your caddie, someone attending the flagstick or a removed or attended flagstick. Touching your line of putt or touching the putting green in pointing out target. The same applies to your caddie. Your caddie marking and lifting your ball on the green. Touching or moving loose impediments in a bunker. There will also be relaxed restrictions to apply on: Touching the sand with your hand or club when your ball is in a bunker. You are now prohibited only from touching the sand (1) with your hand or club to test the condition of the bunker or (2) with your club in the area right behind or in front of the ball, in making a practice swing or in making the back-swing for your stroke. Dropping a ball in a defined relief area. The only requirement is that you hold the ball above the ground without it touching any growing thing or other natural or artificial object. It is recommended that the ball be dropped from at least one inch above the ground. Proposals for things a golfer can do: Repair almost all damage (including spike marks and animal damage) on the green. Keep using any club that is damaged during the round, no matter how it happens. Use distance-measuring devices, except when prohibited by local rules. Play out of turn in stroke play (\u2018ready golf\u2019). This has always been allowed without penalty and now you are affirmatively encouraged to do so in a safe and responsible way. Proposals for things a golfer cannot do: Your caddie is not allowed to stand on a line behind you from the time you begin taking your stance until you have made your stroke.",

Up until then it was an evenly-matched PMQs, and one that, unusually, shed some light on the issue being discussed. Corbyn focused all his questions on the government\u2019s plans to limit the eligibility to personal independence payment (PIP), a disability benefit, in the light of court rulings that would make it easier for people with mental health problems to claim. He was precise and restrained, and he made a moving appeal for the court rulings to be honoured, but without resorting to hyperbole. His best point was when he said there was no point having courts to adjudicate on these matters if their findings are ignored. May made her usual points about the need for a strong economy, but she was better setting out the detail, explaining that current PIP claimants will not lose out and that the government\u2019s legislation will just restore the status quo ante, and she mocked Labour quite effectively by quoting the spokesman who said the party did not know how it would fund implementing the PIP court decisions.

He says parity of esteem means funding mental health properly, and not overriding court decisions that help people with mental health conditions.</p> <p>May says the government is spending more than before on mental health. But there is more to do, she says. More people are being provided with mental health treatment every week. But if you want to provide that help, you need a strong economy to be able to pay for it. The one thing we know about Labour is that it will bankrupt Britain.</p> <p>Corbyn says that is rich coming from a government that has borrowed more than all Labour government\u2019s put together. He says we are judged by how we treat the most vulnerable. Mind has condemned this, he says. Can\u2019t May withdraw this \u201cnasty\u201d decision? That is how we will be judged.</p> <p>May says the agreement of this parliament is being honoured. Corbyn talks about accepting the court\u2019s decision and paying for it. But today Labour\u2019s health spokesman, when asked how Labour would pay for implementing this court decision, said the party had not decided that yet. A Labour MP said the Copeland result was \u201cincredible\u201d for Labour.

That is why the government will clarify them. She says this government is spending more than every on support for people with disabilities, and on people with mental health conditions.</p> <p>Corbyn says the government has overriden an independent court decision on this. He quotes a Tory MP saying the government should give mental and physical health the same priority. He quotes from May\u2019s \u201cnasty party\u201d speech to her party when it was in opposition. Don\u2019t George Freeman\u2019s quotes show the nasty party is still around?</p> <p>May says Freeman has apologised for what he said.

But last week the government sneaked out proposals to cut it again. Will the government change her mind?</p> <p>May says this is not a policy change. This is not a cut in the amount that will be spent on these benefits. No one will see a reduction in their benefits from the DWP. What the government is doing is restoring the system to what was agreed by the last government and by parliament.</p> <p>Corbyn says the social security advisory committee was not consulted on this. He says the court made this announcement to help people suffering overwhelming distress.

He says 1,185 Unite branches, 80% of those who have nominated someone, have backed him for leader.</p> <p>Gerard Coyne, McCluskey\u2019s main challenger (who has accused McCluskey of medding too much in Labour politics, got just 187 branch nominations. Ian Allinson, who is challenging McCluskey from the left, got just 76 branch nominations.</p> <p>Commenting on the figures McCluskey said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am honoured to have received the nomination of so many Unite branches across the UK, working in all sectors of the economy. This incredible level of backing is a vindication of what our great union has achieved for working people under my leadership. It is also a rejection of the cynical approach of one opponent, which is not to offer a positive vision for our union but to taint it with smears and do the bidding of meddlers from outside our union who would rather destroy Unite than see it provide strength and hope for working people.</p> <p>This huge vote of confidence in my leadership demonstrates members want the union to remain proud, democratic and independent of outside interference.</p> </blockquote> <p>Branch nominations are not inevitably an accurate guide to the final election result, because they get decided by the activists who turn up for meetings, but in union elections turnout is often very low - it was just 15% in 2013, when McCluskey was last elected general secretary - and these figures suggest that, as long as voting is dominated by activists, McCluskey should win comfortably.

Some of us felt this was a little unfair, because Labour\u2019s policy output has not been especially rich recently, but this morning <strong>Sarah Champion,</strong> the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, has come out with a policy speech with some profound implications. You can read it in full <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2017/03/champion-women-have-been-hit-hardest-by-austerity-labour-would-change-that/\">here. </a>And here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Champion said Labour would use an economic equality bill to stop budgets favouring men.</strong> For reasons she explained in her speech (see below), she said budget policy making needed \u201cfundamental, structural\u201d change because the current system meant spending decisions disproportionately favoured men. She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am pleased announce today that Labour will build upon current equalities legislation, consulting over the next 12 months on bringing in an economic equality bill.</p> <p>Put simply, this bill would seek to ensure that on equality, the money follows the policy.</p> <p>It will no longer be possible for governments to talk the talk on equality while implementing economic policies that make life harder for women and protected groups.</p> <p>It\u2019s about ensuring that we eliminate intrinsic, structural barriers that prevent people from reaching their full economic potential.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that since 2010 86% of the losses created by tax rises and benefit cuts have affected women not men. </strong>She said this figure included the impact of measures in last year\u2019s autumn statement. Before the autumn statement the figure was 81%, she said. There is more information about the equality impact of the autumn statement in <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CDP-2016-0251#fullreport\">this House of Commons briefing paper.</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She urged the government to adopt \u201cgender budgeting\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At its heart, we expect a budget that works for women as it is a key opportunity for the advancement of gender equality.</p> <p>This concept, often referred to as gender budgeting, now takes place in more than 40 countries around the world.</p> <p>It was originally inspired by the early experiences of countries such as Australia, and then given further momentum by the United Nations commitment to gender budgeting in the Beijing platform for action.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an article this week the Economist has also come out strongly in favour of \u201cgender budgeting\u201d. Here is t<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21717375-sexual-equality-makes-economic-sense-governments-should-measure-it-and-budgets-promote-it-why\">he Economist leader on the subject</a>, and here is <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21717404-designing-fiscal-policies-support-gender-equality-good-growth-why\">the Economist\u2019s news story about what it involves.</a></p> <ul> <li>S<strong>he explained why conventional government accounting disadvantages women.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Women are particularly vulnerable to being hit harder by this Government policies, for a number of reasons.</p> <p>First, social security payments make up a greater share of women\u2019s income than men\u2019s, as women still earn less in the labour market.</p> <p>Women make greater use of public sector care services than men, because they have greater caring responsibilities.</p> <p>Women also pay less direct tax than men, because they tend to earn less. Meaning that tax breaks for top earners disproportionately benefit men.</p> <p>Finally, women are hit harder by this Government\u2019s policies, because a higher proportion of women are employed in the public sector, which is consistently under attack.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>She said conventional definitions of investment also disadvantage women.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Currently, the wages of construction workers paid to build a school count as public investment. However, when government staffs the school to provide education, the wages of the teachers are not counted as investment expenditure, but as current expenditure.</p> <p>The benefits produced by teachers accrue over the years, both to the children who have been educated, and to the wider economy. These are not just \u2018day to day\u2019 immediate benefits.</p> <p>Feminist economists have long argued that the work force is a produced asset that requires investment of resources for it to be available on a daily basis.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said government\u2019s should produce their own gender impact analysis of financial statements, instead of relying on others, like the House of Commons library, to carry out this analysis.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She ridiculed the government\u2019s record on cutting the deficit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When the UK Labour government invested in creating the NHS in 1948, the ratio of debt to GDP was over 200 per cent, and that higher public investment led to higher growth. High debt ratios did not prompt cuts to public investment in the 1940s, 1950s or 1960s.</p> <p>What is unarguable is that at the same time as imposing cruel spending cuts that have been shown to hit women hardest, this government has added almost \u00a3700bn to the national debt.</p> <p>That\u2019s not just more than the last Labour government.</p> <p>It\u2019s more than every Labour government, in history, added together!</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5babdf7361a377792e50af2cdab3aaee37733bf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5babdf7361a377792e50af2cdab3aaee37733bf1/0_83_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Champion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Champion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor De Jesus</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b694c2e4b030b6f7c9049a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T09:47:59.746Z\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nigel Farage,</strong> the former Ukip leader, was on the Today programme this morning renewing his call for Douglas Carswell, the party\u2019s only MP, to be expelled from the party.

      "bodyText": "Ministers vowed to reverse a major defeat in the Lords on their article 50 legislation after peers voted by a majority of 102 to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK after Brexit. It was Theresa May\u2019s first parliamentary defeat on Brexit and it came after a sometimes heated three-hour debate that saw numerous peers argue that parliament has a moral right to ensure that the 3m EU nationals in Britain can stay after Brexit. Lord Bridges, a Brexit minister, said the government should not give this assurance until it negotiates a reciprocal deal guaranteeing the rights of Britons living in other EU countries. He said the government was \u201cconfident\u201d it could get a \u201cquick and timely\u201d deal on this when the Brexit talks start. (See 6.37pm.) But, with Labour and the Lib Dems joining forces to back the cross-party amendment, the government was heavily defeated. Although Douglas Hogg (Viscount Hailsham), a Conservative rightwinger, gave a passionate speech in favour of the amendment (see 3.51pm), only seven Tories voted with the opposition. (See 7.17pm.) Ministers face a second defeat next week, when peers vote on an amendment guaranteeing parliament a vote on the final Brexit deal. But the government is determined to reverse the defeats when the bill returns to the Commons, probably on Monday 13 March, and it is expected that at that point the House of Lords will back down and let the elected chamber have its way. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Monique Hawkins, a Dutch woman who highlighted the plight of EU citizens when she revealed last December she had been asked to \u201cprepare to leave\u201d the country after 24 years, said she was \u201cheartened\u201d to hear so many moving and inspiring speeches. She said she was concerned that the amendment however would not cover stay-at-home parents, carers, disabled and students who decided to continue their lives in Britain but did not take out health insurance when they arrived in the country. Paddy Ashdown, the Lib Dem peer and former party leader, said there had been a \u201ccollective release of emotion\u201d from peers tonight. This House has sat cowering, with its hands behind it head, refusing to speak, shelled daily by the government and suddenly the House of Lords says \u2018no!\u2019. This is a matter of honour, of principle, and we will insist. At last this beast of parliament has found a voice. Ashdown said he hoped it would send a signal to the EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens abroad that they were being heard. And he said that he believed the defeat would galvanise opposition to the government. I hope every individual will now examine their conscience and realise that a parliament that allows a government to ride roughshod over it is in dereliction of its duty. The House of Lords has just published the breakdown showing how peers voted. For the amendment Labour: 165 Lib Dems: 93 Crossbenchers: 78 Others: 13 Conservatives: 7 (Lady Altmann, Lord Bowness, Lord Cormack, Viscount Hailsham, Lord Livingston of Parkhead, Earl Selborne and Lady Wheatcroft) Bishops: 2 Against the amendment Conservatives: 213 Crossbenchers: 30 Others: 10 Bishops: 3 The government will seek to overturn the House of Lords defeat on the Brexit bill in the Commons, government sources said. Jenny Jones, the Green peer, was among those who had backed leaving the EU but voted for the amendment. She said: I was for Brexit but I want a good Brexit. I want to make sure we continue to have and improve social and environmental protections and grow our economy. Of course the government should guarantee the rights of EU citizens, so of course I\u2019ve backed the amendment. And the Labour MP Peter Kyle issued this statement on behalf of Open Britain, which is campaigning for a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit. He said: I\u2019m delighted that the House of Lords have stood up to the government and voted to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in Britain. I proudly voted for the amendment a few weeks ago and I will do the same again. I urge MPs of all parties to do the decent thing and support the amendment when it returns to the House of Commons. No matter what party you are in or whether you campaigned to leave or remain, there is both a practical and a moral imperative to protect the rights of three million people who now face crippling uncertainty about their future as British residents. Gisela Stuart, chair of the pro-leave Change Britain group, issued this response to the vote on the group\u2019s behalf. She said: This bill is simply about giving the prime minister the authority to trigger article 50. Nothing more, nothing less. There are of course issues which need to be resolved, such as the status of EU nationals, but these should be done separately to the bill. There will be plenty of opportunities to debate these issues in the coming months, and guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens will be a priority. Harriet Harman, the Labour former deputy leader and chair of the joint committee on human rights, which tabled an amendment to the bill on the rights of EU nationals, welcomed the result of the vote. She said: I welcome the House of Lords decision to protect the rights of EU citizens. This implements a recommendation made by JCHR in its recent report on Brexit and human rights. I urge the PM not to seek to overturn this amendment and thereby prolong the distressing uncertainty for the 3m EU citizens who make such an important contribution to our country, including the NHS, agriculture, universities and many other sectors. A coalition of 13 groups representing British nationals abroad and EU citizens in the UK said it was \u201cdelighted\u201d describing the vote as \u201c positive step in the right direction\u201d. It said it was concerned that \u201cthe amendment makes no mention of UK citizens in the EEA\u201d despite the efforts of the grass roots groups across Europe to get their message across. They represent more than 25,000 UK citizens in the EU including British nationals in Spain, France and Germany. Jeremy Morgan QC, representing the coalition of residents in Europe, said: They are also facing huge uncertainty about their futures, livelihoods and the security of their families \u2013 the same concerns facing EU and EEA citizens in the UK, whose campaign for a unilateral guarantee we fully support. The majority of UK citizens in the EU are working people - many with families. Others are poorer, vulnerable retirees who only moved to southern Europe to make small pensions stretch further. All of these people are facing huge uncertainty - they are real people who can\u2019t put their lives on hold while politicians try to hammer out other aspects of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. This amendment, while a positive development, could have also have gone further to end the uncertainty for EU and EEA citizens in the UK than it does. In particular, the reference to \u201clegal residence\u201d could be interpreted by the Home Office in a way to limit the acquired rights of EU citizens already resident in the UK. The Brexit department has said it is \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the vote. A spokesman for the department said: We are disappointed the Lords have chosen to amend a bill that the Commons passed without amendment. The bill has a straightforward purpose - to enact the referendum result and allow the government to get on with the negotiations. Our position on EU nationals has repeatedly been made clear. We want to guarantee the rights of EU citizens who are already living in Britain, and the rights of British nationals living in other member states, as early as we can. Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, tells BBC News that she hopes the government will think again when this bill returns to the Commons and accepts the amendment. Nicolas Hatton, the chairman of the3million campaign group which has been lobbying for the rights of EU citizens, described the vote as \u201cbrilliant\u201d He said it was \u201ca relief\u201d that for the first time since the referendum, a majority has been found in parliament to support the rights of the 3m EU citizens \u201cwho came in good faith to live and work the UK\u201d. The3million said it would be contacting all Conservative MPs before next week to make its case \u201co stop the unfair treatment\u201d of EU citizens before article 50 is triggered. \u201cWe are not bargaining chips, we are people,\u201d he said. However he said he still he had concerns over the term \u201clegally resident\u201d in the amendment as the Home Office could decide that certain EU citizens who do not have private health insurance are not legal even though this was never made clear to them. It is also concerned about the cut-off dates. Paddy Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader, has just told BBC News that the government will have learnt a lesson in \u201chumanity and principle and decency, and parliamentary power as well\u201d from the vote. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has issued this statement about the result. This is a really welcome and important step forward. For months Labour has been urging the prime minister to end unnecessary uncertainty for EU citizens in the UK, and I am delighted our colleagues in the Lords have sent this clear message to the prime minister. Labour believe that EU nationals should not be used as bargaining chips in Brexit negotiations. There is a growing consensus that this must be resolved before article 50 is triggered, and the prime minister is now increasingly isolated. Labour will continue to support this simple but effective amendment when it returns to the Commons, and urge MPs on all sides of the House to do so. Peers have voted by 358 votes to 256, a majority of 102, to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK after Brexit. The precise wording of the amendment that has been added to the bill is here, at 3.17pm. In his winding up speech Lord Bridges, the Brexit minister, said the government was confident it would be able to reach a \u201cquick and timely\u201d agreement with other EU countries on the reciprocal rights of nationals once Brexit talks begin. He said: The government has said this issue will be an early priority for the negotiations. And, my lords, the encouraging messages from European leaders, most recently heard during the secretary of state [David Davis\u2019s] recent visit to the Baltics, makes the government confident that we will indeed be able to reach a quick and timely agreement with the European Union. Lady Hayter is summing up now for Labour. She says it is wrong to suggest that peers on her side of the argument are not concerned about the interests of Britons on the continent. She says she is getting messages all the time. She quotes from someone living in France, who says he backs her stance. We are not bargaining chips, she says. She says there would be a problem putting this into the main Brexit negotiation. Some countries have only a small number of Britons living in them, she says. She says there would be a risk of one country holding up a deal on this because it wanted something for itself. And that\u2019s it. Peers are voting now. Bridges says the government wants fairness. If the government gives a unilateral guarantee to EU nationals living here, what will happen to Britons on the continent. He says he does not for a moment question the motives of those who have tabled the amendments. But he asks peers to think of the consequences of backing them. Bridges says there will be no legislation on immigration. This will not be covered by the great repeal bill. It will be in a separate bill, he says. But he says the government does not want EU nationals to have to rely on the ECHR to stay after Brexit. Instead, it wants to rely on reciprocity. The government wants EU nationals in the UK to have their rights guaranteed, and Britons living in other EU countries to have their rights guaranteed. He says Theresa May pressed for an early agreement. But a \u201csmall number\u201d of EU countries blocked this, he says. He says messages from EU leaders, including to David Davis when he visited the Baltics recently, suggest this can be sorted out quickly. Lord Bridges of Headley, a Brexit minister, is winding up now. He says this is one of the most emotive issue, if not the most emotive issue, raised by Brexit. He says peers all agree that they have a duty and responsibility to Britons living in Europe. And they all value the contribution made by EU nationals living in Britian. They all know Brexit has brought them uncertainty. And they all want to do what is right. He says the amendments all propose a unilateral declaration guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals. But, discussing the rights of 4m people, he does not want to get over-legalistic. He wants to make two points. First, between now and Brexit, nothing will change for EU nationals living in the UK. They keep their treaty rights. There is no need for them to apply for documents saying they can stay. He says the government will do what it can to simplify the process of applying for residence. With regard to the requirement for private medical insurance, he says this is an EU requirement, not a UK requirement. As to the future, the government remains bound by the European convention of human rights, including the right to family life. He says the government will continue to be bound by the ECHR after Brexit, including article eight, covering the right to family life. Bridges says European convention on human rights will continue to apply to EU nationals in UK after Brexit. Lord Strathclyde, the Conservative former leader of the Lords, says this amendment will create more uncertainty for Britons living abroad. He says the amendments are at the wrong time on the wrong subject. Peers should support EU nationals living in Europe, he says. Lord Woolf, the crossbencher and former lord chief justice, says he thinks this matter is best resolved by parliament, not the courts. He says he will vote for the amendment for the reasons given by Viscount Hailsham. This is a matter of moral principle, he says, as well as possible legal principle. And, on the moral issue, there is only one answer, he says. Lord Blencathra, the former Conservative Home Office minister David Maclean, says originally he thought it would be best to make a unilateral declaration guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals living in the UK. He thought that might lead to the EU reciprocating. But that did not happen. He says Theresa May press for an early decision on this. Some 20 EU states agreed. But Angela Merkel and Donald Tusk opposed the idea, arguing that this should wait until the Brexit talks start. He says it is the government\u2019s duty to look after Britons living in Europe, more than EU nationals living here. Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, a crossbencher and former diplomat credited with drafting article 50, says this negotiation will be a \u201cnothing is agreed until everything is agreed\u201d negotiation. So it could be the case that a deal for the reciprocal rights of Britons and EU nationals does not get agreed for another two years. Given that is the case, it would be better to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK now, he says. The Labour peer Lord Clark of Windermere says the NHS is under threat because of the shortage of labour. It depends on foreigner workers; 10% of doctors and 5% of nurses come from the EU. We are not in a good negotiating position, because many of these workers would be more use back in their own countries. Lord Kirkhope of Harrogate, the former leader of Conservative MEPs and former immigration minister, says nothing in the bill will affect the rights of EU nationals living in the UK. There will be an immigration bill later, he says, that will address this issue. He says other EU countries accept the case of reciprocity with regard to this issue. So these amendments are unnecessary and illogical, he says. Lord Green of Deddington, the crossbencher and MigrationWatch, is speaking now. He says EU nationals who have been in the UK for five years have the right to stay. And he says if the government guarantees their rights unilaterally, the interests of Britons living in other EU countries will slip down the list of priorities. Lord Campbell of Pittenweem, the former Lib Dem leader, says he agrees with Douglas Hogg\u2019s speech. He says the impact of the UK losing EU workers would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. He says asking EU relatives to leave would be unacceptable. What sort of stress would that put on families, he asks? He says David Davis has said it will take \u201cyears and years\u201d to train British workers to fill the jobs being done by EU workers. He says Hogg is right to say parliament has been very reluctant to pass legislation with retrospective effect. The only recent example he can think of is the bill for the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. Lady Symons, the Labour peer, says this is a simple matter of principle. The Lords should be able to do the right thing, because it is the right thing. Lord Lawson, the Conservative former chancellor, says he lives in France. He would have liked to have seen the government give an unconditional guarantee that EU nationals living in the UK could stay, he says. But he does not support the amendment, he says. Like John Sentamu, he does not think this is an appropriate addition to the bill. He also says there is no need for the amendment, because there is no way that Britain would throw out EU nationals. So the only purpose of this amendment is \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d. And he says it would stir up fear amongst EU nationals. Lord Kerslake, the crossbencher and former head of the civil service, is speaking now. He says he has reflected on Amber Rudd\u2019s letter. But he is backing the amendment. The arguments in favour are both practical and principled, he says. He says the principled arguments have already been well made. He does not think peers want EU nationals living in the UK to leave. So the argument is just about whether giving EU nationals the right to say now disadvantages the UK. But that does amount to using EU nationals as a bargaining chip, he says. He says the government does not have the power to be able to say it will be able to strike a deal with the EU quickly, because it is not in the UK\u2019s gift. In the meantime EU nationals in the UK face uncertainty. And there are some sectors of the economy that would be damaged without EU workers, such as building new homes, having a functioning NHS and good quality care. He says he does not think the risk is worth taking. Sometimes the right thing in life is to do the right thing. Lady Hamwee, a Lib Dem peer, says she is speaking in favour of amendment 25, which she tabled on behalf of the joint committee on human rights. It also proposes guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals. This would not delay or frustrate leaving the EU, she says. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, is in the Lords to listen to the debate. This is from the Press Association\u2019s Jack Maidment. Viscount Waverley, a hereditary peer and a crossbencher, says that he has thought about this deeply, including taking account of the views of Britons living on the continent. He says he has concluded that the best step is to give the government a free run. Lord Bowness, a Conservative peer, says he is backing the amendment. He says this debate goes to the heart of what country we are. No one would believe that Britain would remove EU nationals living here, he says. So it is pointless to pretend otherwise, he suggests. I don\u2019t find the argument that we should only be prepared to confirm the rights of EU nationals living here as part of the negotiation about our own citizens acceptable. I think it is a misjudged position to adopt and wrong both politically and in terms of justice and fairness. Lady Kennedy of the Shaws, the QC and Labour peer, said the honour of the Lords was at stake with this amendment. She said she was backing it. I have beefed up some of the previous posts with direct quotes. To get them to show up, you may need to refresh the page. Lord Tebbit, the Conservative former party chairman, is speaking now. He says the first duty of parliament is to think of the interests of British citizens. So we should be thinking of the rights of Britons living abroad. But today we are thinking of foreigners, he says. Some peers object to this. It seems to me that the first duty of this parliament of the United Kingdom is to care for the interests of the citizens of this kingdom. If we are to be concerned about anybody\u2019s rights after Brexit, to live anywhere on this continent of Europe, it should be our concern for the rights of British people to live freely and peacefully in those other parts. Somehow or other today we seem to be thinking of nothing but the rights of foreigners. Responding to criticism of his comments, Tebbit said: People of nationalities of other countries within the Union are foreigners. Why is everybody here today so excited about an amendment that looks after the foreigners and not the British? Lord Oates, a Lib Dem peer, is backing amendment 9b, and also another on this topic in his name. He says the government has failed to provide moral leadership or administrative clarity on this issue. He says the rule saying some EU nationals need comprehensive health insurance in order to be able to qualify for UK residency should be waived. Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Conservative former lord chancellor, says there are a large number of EU citizens born in one country but living in another under the protection of EU treaties. He says the moral high ground is to treat these people equally. They are all humans, he says. He says he repudiates the idea that people should be treated as negotiating chips. But he says the EU has set out a mechanism for resolving these matters. It is set out in article 50. This bill will allow the government to trigger article 50, he says. He says he agrees with the archbishop of York (see 4.22pm); he thinks the bill should be passed quickly, and the government should then challenge the EU to back a reciprocal deal. Lady Royall, the Labour former leader of the Lords, says at the Tory conference Liam Fox, the international development secretary, said that EU nationals living in the UK were bargaining chips. That is why she doesn\u2019t trust the government on this, she says. Mackay says he does not regard himself as bound by what Liam Fox says on anything. Dafydd Wigley, the former Plaid Cymru leader, says he is backing the amendment, as well as a similar one in his name. He says EU workers play a vital role in Wales. Thousands of people are looking to this House to give a lead and I hope we don\u2019t let them down. Lord Hannay, the crossbencher and former ambassador to the UN, says he is backing the amendment. He says he does not accept the argument that passing this amendment will undermine the position of Britons living in other EU countries. He says a group representing this group has put out a statement today saying peers should vote for the amendment. The archbishop of York, John Sentamu, is speaking now. He says he came to the UK as a consequence of what happened in Uganda when the Ugandan Asians were kicked out. So he understands the feelings of immigrants, he says. He says this is a simple bill. He quotes from Magna Carta, and the provisions relating to Habeas Corpus. He says EU citizens living in the UK are protected by these rights. He suggests now is not the time to guarantee their rights. The time to consider this is when the great repeal bill comes to parliament, he suggests. He says the government should call Angela Merkel\u2019s bluff over this. That could ensure a guarantee for the EU nationals living in the EU soon, more quickly than the within the three months mentioned in the amendment. (See 3.17pm.) We should leave this bill, he says. Passing this amendment would not amount to revising the bill. It would be adding to it, he says. The Green peer, Jenny Jones, asks Sentamu if he understands the argument that giving EU nationals the right to stay would give the government the moral high ground. Sentamu says he does not want to see anyone used as a bargaining chip. As soon as this becomes law, campaigners will then find it easier to put pressure on the prime minister, because she won\u2019t then be able to stress the need for article 50 to be passed first. She suggests Theresa May sets up a truth and listening commission in all countries of the UK to listen to what people are saying about Brexit. Melvyn Bragg, the Labour peer, says 3m people in a population of 60m are a minority. Minorities have benefited this country enormously, he says. Minorities have helped us become the best of what we are. He says he can speak strongly for minorities, because he is a member of one - a bullied minority. Like the prime minister, he is one of the 48% who voted to remain, he says. He says Theresa May should have decided to fight on, as other minorities do. He thinks it is wrong for a single issue vote to change the country so dramatically. He says Brexit will be a \u201cdisaster\u201d. We should tell EU nationals here that we want them to stay here, and that they are welcome, he says. Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader and former home secretary, is speaking now. He says that he wants to help EU nationals living in the UK, but that the best way to do that is to pass the article 50 bill as quickly as possible. The question which we have to ask ourselves today is this - how can we best help the EU nationals who are resident in this country? The best way in which we can help them is to bring the uncertainty of their position to an end as quickly as possible. The best way of bringing that uncertainty to an end as quickly as possible is to pass this bill as quickly as possible and to activate article 50 as quickly as possible. Lady Ludford, the Lib Dem Brexit spokewoman, told peers that giving EU nationals the right to stay in the UK was the right thing to do morally. It is disingenuous to inflame the fears of British people settled elsewhere in Europe that their place will be undermined by a unilateral move by the British government. Here is a quote from Viscount Hailsham\u2019s speech. It is probable that if we seek to deny European citizens now resident in the United Kingdom the right to continue to stay here, we would be challenged in the courts and that challenge might well succeed. Moreover, my lords, as a matter of general principle legislation and policies which are retrospective in their operation should be avoided. Individuals are entitled to regulate their affairs in accordance with the law that applies at the time that they make their decisions. To depart from that principle exposes all of us [to a risk] to our freedoms and to the ability to make safe choices. I will post more from his speech soon. Hailsham says many peers have relatives who were born abroad. His grandmother was born in Tennessee. He says peers like himself would find in unacceptable if their relatives were forced to leave. And he recalls speaking a woman working in the Commons dining room, from France, who wanted to know what would happen to EU nationals like her after Brexit. On Monday I was lunching in the dining room in the House of Commons where I was meeting staff whom I have known for very many years. And one of the waitresses came up to me - I\u2019ve know her for year - and she said: \u201cWhat is going to happen to me when Brexit takes place.\u201d She was born in France but has worked in the United Kingdom, has been in the House of Commons, for very many years. I gave her my personal opinion, which was that there would be no problem for her, but I was not able to give her the guarantee that I think she was entitled to deserve. In the end this is matter of principle. This House can in fact make a unilateral decision and give a unilateral guarantee and, my lords, that is what we should do. Let us all remember how shocked we were when Idi Amin expelled the Asians from Uganda, so shocked that we offered them refuge in this country. And, for those who are historians, I say keep in mind how shocked Europe was when Louis XIV revoked the edict of Nantes, causing thousand of Hugenots to flee France, often to the United Kingdom, to the great impoverishment of France. I don\u2019t say that we are going to do this. I don\u2019t think it is likely that we will. But I do say that we have not put it outside our power for that to happen, and that is wrong. I do ask your lordships to take the high moral ground and give reassurance to the millions who have made their home here in the expectation that they will continue to live and work here. And, addressing the minister, Lord Bridges, he says: The moral high ground is often the best ground on which to fight a campaign. Viscount Hailsham (Douglas Hogg), the Conservative former cabinet minister, says he will support any of the amendments on this topic put to a vote. He says he understands the government\u2019s argument: that it needs to keep on the table the future of EU nationals in the UK as a bargaining chip. He says while he understands this argument, he is not comfortable with it. Many EU nationals came here thinking they would be able to stay for good. That could have been a life-changing decision for them, he says. He says for the UK to deny them this right would be an act of retrospective legislation that would offend natural justice. If the UK tried to prevent EU nationals from staying, that would be challenged in the courts. And that challenge might succeed, he says. It is probable that if we seek to deny European citizens now resident in the United Kingdom the right to continue to stay here, we would be challenged in the courts and that challenge might well succeed. Moreover, my lords, as a matter of general principle legislation and policies which are retrospective in their operation should be avoided. Individuals are entitled to regulate their affairs in accordance with the law that applies at the time that they make their decisions. To depart from that principle exposes all of us [to a risk] to our freedoms and to the ability to make safe choices. Hayter says 1985 Lord Kinnock had to say to his own party \u201cyou can\u2019t play politics with people\u2019s jobs\u201d. Now she has to so you cannot do negotiations with people\u2019s livelihoods, she says. Hayter says EU nationals have come to the UK in good faith expecting certain rights. In addition to their moral obligation towards these people, peers should also consider the need for these workers in the labour market, she says. She says the food and drinks industry is reliant on EU workers. She says the Food and Drink Federation, the3million group and the British Chambers of Commerce are among those groups saying EU nationals should be given the right to stay now. Lady Hayter of Kentish Town, the Labour Brexit spokeswoman, is opening the debate now. She says peers have heard the worries of Britons who live abroad. It is not acceptable to put them under pressure, she says. But she says the interests of the EU nationals living in the UK and the interests of Britons living in other EU countries should not be played against each other. The issues are different, she says. She says the UK can unilaterally decide what happens to EU nationals living in the UK. She says the amendment 9b says EU nationals living her will have their rights guaranteed. They should not be made to wait two years, she says. Since we\u2019re on the subject of Brexit, this is intriguing. Here is the full text of the speech Sir John Major gave on Monday, Britain and Europe - A Reality Check (pdf). It is likely that David Cameron agreed with every word of it. According to the latest Guardian ICM opinion poll, the public is split down the middle on the issue of the rights of EU nationals. In our latest survey we asked whether the government should guarantee EU nationals living in the UK now that they will be allowed to stay, as Labour and other opposition parties are demanding; or whether it should wait until Britons living in other EU countries should also get their rights guaranteed, as Theresa May is proposing. Here are the results. The government should not give EU nationals living in the UK the right to stay until Britons living in other EU countries get the same right: 42% The government should guarantee the rights of EU nationals now, because it is the right thing to do and may get negotiations off to a good start: 41% Don\u2019t know: 17% For the record, here are the current state of the parties figures for the Lords. Conservatives: 252 Labour: 202 Crossbench: 177 Lib Dems: 102 Bishops: 26 These figures help to explain why, when Labour and the Lib Dems unite against them, the Conservatives find it almost impossible to win a Lords vote. Yesterday Amber Rudd, the home secretary, wrote to peers saying they should reject the 9b amendment because, if it were passed, Britons living in other EU countries would face two years of uncertainty because EU countries would be in no hurry to guarantee their rights. In response the Labour leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, said: To continue to use people as bargaining chips in this way is not only shameful but could have a dire impact on the UK\u2019s economy and essential services. Confirming the rights of those EU citizens living in the UK can only be of benefit to our citizens worried about their future in EU countries but the government\u2019s approach seems to be to sit back and wait for others to blink first. The home secretary\u2019s letter is deeply disappointing and illustrates clearly why we will need a vote in the Lords tomorrow to allow the government and MPs to think this issue through and reconsider. Peers will soon begin the second day of the committee stage debate on the article 50 bill. Almost 50 amendments to the bill have been tabled (you can read them all here - pdf) and many will be debated today (in the order set out in the grouping here). But the main focus will be on amendment 9b, a cross-party amendment backed by Labour and the Lib Dems on the rights of EU nationals. There will be a vote on this at around 5.30pm, and the government is set to lose. The amendment says the government should guarantee now that EU nationals living in the UK will have their rights protected after Brexit, instead of waiting until Britons living in the EU also get their rights guaranteed before making that commitment, which is Theres May\u2019s current policy. Here is the precise wording of the amendment. Within three months of exercising the power under section 1(1), Ministers of the Crown must bring forward proposals to ensure that citizens of another European Union or European Economic Area country and their family members, who are legally resident in the United Kingdom on the day on which this Act is passed, continue to be treated in the same way with regards to their EU derived-rights and, in the case of residency, their potential to acquire such rights in the future. And here is the Guardian\u2019s preview story. Jeremy Corbyn has accused Theresa May of turning the Conservatives back into \u201cthe nasty party\u201d by quietly announcing a change to rules on disability benefits. Sarah Champion, the shadow secretary of state for women and equality, has said Labour would introduce an economic equality bill to stop budgets favouring men. (See 11.10am and 11.54am.) Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has said that 80% of Unite branches that have nominated someone in the union\u2019s leadership election have nominated him. (See 11.46am.) In response a spokesman for Gerard Coyne, his main challenger, said: The number of nominations each candidate received is no guide to the eventual result. This is clear from previous elections. For instance, in the last contest for the post of general secretary of Amicus, before that union merged with the TGWU to form Unite, the incumbent, Ken Jackson received 352 nominations, but was beaten by the challenger, Derek Simpson, who had 93 nominations. Len McCluskey is a machine politician, elected by one in ten Unite members on a low turn out. Full time Unite officials were under heavy pressure during the nomination period to deliver for McCluskey. Gerard Coyne is appealing to the mass of Unite members who are not part of the McCluskey machine. He is very pleased to have received nominations from every region of the UK, despite the machine, and he will win. Contractors bidding for work with the government are being asked to affirm that they back Brexit. Ministers are to announce that sex education will become compulsory for secondary school pupils, while children as young as four will be taught about modern relationships. Theresa May has said the government will look at markets that are not working for consumers amid pressure to crack down on online ticket websites \u201cfleecing\u201d customers. Referring to abuses highlighted by the Guardian, Tory MP Nigel Adams said at PMQs it was \u201cunfair\u201d that website Viagogo was reselling tickets to an Ed Sheeran charity concert for upwards of \u00a31,000, and that tickets to the Hamilton musical were being sold on the site for more than \u00a35,000 - even though anyone with a resold ticket would not be allowed in. In response May said: He\u2019s absolutely right to identify those circumstances as he does, where there are websites that are acting in the way he talks about and causing the problems he talks about for people who genuinely believe they\u2019re able to buy tickets for what they wish to attend. I understand he\u2019s recently met the minister [Matt Hancock] to discuss this issue and, as he will be aware, the Consumer Rights Act introduced new rules on ticketing and a review of online ticket sales, and DCMS are going to shortly respond to the independent report by Professor Michael Waterson on this issue. But we are, as a government, looking at the general issue of where markets are not working in the interests of consumers. Ukip\u2019s former leader Nigel Farage has accused the party\u2019s only MP of preventing it from becoming a radical anti-immigration party. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has said a Brexit trade dispute between the UK and the rest of the European Union would be \u201cpolitically irresponsible\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d for the global economy. In a speech in Germany he said: Any new impediments to trade and investment in Europe would not only be politically irresponsible, but economically dangerous, and not just for Europe but for the wider global economy too. We do not act in a political vacuum and our economic action will have global implications ... The simple reality is that for Britain to wish failure upon the EU would be to wish failure on ourselves, and vice versa. The economic destinies of Britain and Europe, and the prosperity of our people, are too closely enmeshed. Damian Collins, the Conservative chair of the Commons culture committee, has criticised Donald Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201cfake news\u201d. Speaking to students at a meeting at the Press Association on Wednesday, he said: We have to fight for the term \u2018fake news\u2019. What Donald Trump is doing, and I think it\u2019s a pernicious thing that he\u2019s doing, is to try and interpret the term fake news as being anything that he doesn\u2019t like or agree with. I think the reason that that\u2019s dangerous is that there are real sources of fake news out there, and growing sources too. And it\u2019s not just celebrity tittle-tattle or gossip about politicians. Families with children are the biggest losers under universal credit, with some families left thousands of pounds worse off, according to a new analysis. At PMQs Theresa May said that Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, called his Labour opposite number, Debbie Abrahams, to tell her about the proposed changes to the personal independence payment but that there was no answer and no response for four days. On Twitter Abrahams has challenged this. Responding to this tweet, she said: This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs on Twitter. There does not seem to be much consensus about who did best, although there does seem to be broad agreement on my Twitter feed that this wasn\u2019t exactly a must-see occasion. From the Mirror\u2019s Jason Beattie, who calls it a 1/1 draw From the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton From the Sun\u2019s Harry Cole From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Jack Blanchard From Reaction\u2019s Iain Martin From the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush From Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From the Evening Standard\u2019s Kate Proctor At PMQs Theresa May argued that Jeremy Corbyn was in a weak position to criticise her over the move to restrict eligibility to PIP because Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, refused to say when interviewed about this how Labour would fund \u00a33.7bn cost of not restricting eligbility. On the Daily Politics Ashworth responded, saying it was unreasonable to expect Labour to be able to answer that now. He said: I hardly think it was a zinger to say the Labour party can\u2019t write a budget for 2022, 2023 in 2017. I think it\u2019s entirely reasonable not to expect the Labour party to write its budget in 2017 for six years down the line. As we go into the next election we will put forward our detailed plans for all our spending commitments ... And [May] knows that. She used to make these type of arguments when she was the shadow work and pensions secretary when we were in government. As usual, I missed the questions from Angus Robertson, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, because I was writing up the snap verdict. So here they are. He asked if all decisions about agriculture and fisheries in Scotland would be devolved to Edinburgh after Brexit. Theresa May replied: The right honourable gentleman knows very well that we are discussing with the devolved administrations the whole question of the UK framework and devolution of issues as they come back from Brussels. The overriding aim is making sure we don\u2019t damage the very important single market of the United Kingdom. Robertson then tried again. Will the prime minister confirm today that it is her intention to ensure that it is UK ministers that will negotiate and regulate over large areas that impact on Scottish fisheries and agriculture post-Brexit? May replied: He seems not to have quite understood this point, that we are in the process of discussing which of those powers that currently reside in Brussels will return and remain at a UK level and which will be devolved. It will be the UK government negotiating with the EU, taking full account of the interests and concerns of the devolved administrations and, indeed of all the other regions of England. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. PMQs is over. Trudy Harrison, the new Conservative MP for Copeland, is taking her seat now. Labour\u2019s Madeleine Moon says families in Bridgend are frightened by the threat posed to the Ford plant. May says the automative sector is one of the most productive sectors in the world. Ford is an important investor, she says. The government will continue to have a dialogue with Ford, she says. Rebecca Pow, a Conservative, says that if the speaker, John Bercow, took a shower this morning, there would have been microbeads in his shower gel. Does May welcome the government\u2019s plan to ban these? May says she does not know if Bercow took a shower this morning. But the government does want to ban microbeads by October. Nigel Dodds, the DUP MP, mentions the speeches by Tony Blair and John Major on Brexit. \u201cVery helpful they were,\u201d he says, sarcastically. We know what is meant by a hard Brexit and a soft Brexit. But we don\u2019t know what a soft coup is, he says. He asks May to confirm that, whatever Blair and Major says, she will trigger article 50. May says she intends to trigger by the end of March. And she means triggering article 50, not triggering a soft coup. Labour\u2019s Sir Kevin Barron asks if the government will reform pharmacy funding. May says funding for pharmacies has increased. She says the system was changed last summer to help pharmacies in rural areas. Andrew Selous, a Conservative, asks May if she will end the practice of developers buying freehold land and selling it on a leasehold basis. May says the housing white paper says developers should build homes for people to live in. The government will tackle abuses of leasehold, she says. She says she does not see why homes should not be sold freehold, except in exceptional circumstances. Victoria Prentis, a Conservative, says the debate in Copeland about maternity services echoed what is happening in Banbury. She asks May if she agrees that maternity servics should be local. May says she looks forward to welcoming the new MP for Copeland to the Commons soon. Trudy Harrison, the new MP, has proposed a review of maternity services in Copeland. May says the health minister is looking at this. Judith Cummins, the Labour MP, asks the government to commit to HS3 and infrastructure spending in West Yorkshire. May says the government is committed to investment in the north. Glyn Davies, a Welsh Conservative MP, asks May if she agrees that Welsh interests must remain at the heart of the UK. May agrees. She says she is committed to getting a deal that works for the whole of the UK in Brexit. She will be hosting a St David\u2019s day reception at Downing Street tonight. And she says something in Welsh - happy St David\u2019s day, I presume. PMQs - Snap verdict: May was doing fine until the final word, when her half-hearted, deep-voice, apparent Thatcher parody confirmed that she should probably leave the jokes and funny accents to others. Up until then it was an evenly-matched PMQs, and one that, unusually, shed some light on the issue being discussed. Corbyn focused all his questions on the government\u2019s plans to limit the eligibility to personal independence payment (PIP), a disability benefit, in the light of court rulings that would make it easier for people with mental health problems to claim. He was precise and restrained, and he made a moving appeal for the court rulings to be honoured, but without resorting to hyperbole. His best point was when he said there was no point having courts to adjudicate on these matters if their findings are ignored. May made her usual points about the need for a strong economy, but she was better setting out the detail, explaining that current PIP claimants will not lose out and that the government\u2019s legislation will just restore the status quo ante, and she mocked Labour quite effectively by quoting the spokesman who said the party did not know how it would fund implementing the PIP court decisions. So perhaps Corbyn had the edge, but broadly it was a score-draw. Corbyn says it was a Labour amendement that introduced parity of esteem. He says parity of esteem means funding mental health properly, and not overriding court decisions that help people with mental health conditions. May says the government is spending more than before on mental health. But there is more to do, she says. More people are being provided with mental health treatment every week. But if you want to provide that help, you need a strong economy to be able to pay for it. The one thing we know about Labour is that it will bankrupt Britain. Corbyn says that is rich coming from a government that has borrowed more than all Labour government\u2019s put together. He says we are judged by how we treat the most vulnerable. Mind has condemned this, he says. Can\u2019t May withdraw this \u201cnasty\u201d decision? That is how we will be judged. May says the agreement of this parliament is being honoured. Corbyn talks about accepting the court\u2019s decision and paying for it. But today Labour\u2019s health spokesman, when asked how Labour would pay for implementing this court decision, said the party had not decided that yet. A Labour MP said the Copeland result was \u201cincredible\u201d for Labour. That sums up Corbyn\u2019s leadership. \u201cIncredible\u201d, she says (dropping her voice, in that faux Thatcher style she deployed in her first PMQs.) Corbyn says calling the chairs of two committees does not add up to scrutiny. And, as far as he understands it, there was no call to the shadow secretary of state. He asks May to look at the effects of her decision and think again. May says the factors Corbyn has raised are taken into account. May says the court said the rules were unclear. That is why the government will clarify them. She says this government is spending more than every on support for people with disabilities, and on people with mental health conditions. Corbyn says the government has overriden an independent court decision on this. He quotes a Tory MP saying the government should give mental and physical health the same priority. He quotes from May\u2019s \u201cnasty party\u201d speech to her party when it was in opposition. Don\u2019t George Freeman\u2019s quotes show the nasty party is still around? May says Freeman has apologised for what he said. This government has introduced parity between mental and physical health. Labour did not do that when it was in government. Jeremy Corbyn also wishes people a happy St David\u2019s day. And he hopes the workers at the Ford plant at Bridgend get the assurances they need. He pays tribute to Sir Gerald Kaufman. It was his funeral yesterday, he says. He spoke to Kaufman\u2019s nephews. They described him as an \u201cawesome uncle\u201d. He says that Iain Duncan Smith resigned after the last budget over PIP cuts. But last week the government sneaked out proposals to cut it again. Will the government change her mind? May says this is not a policy change. This is not a cut in the amount that will be spent on these benefits. No one will see a reduction in their benefits from the DWP. What the government is doing is restoring the system to what was agreed by the last government and by parliament. Corbyn says the social security advisory committee was not consulted on this. He says the court made this announcement to help people suffering overwhelming distress. He quotes an MP saying the courts are there for a reason. May says the PIP is better for people with mental health conditions. Two thirds of them get the higher daily living allowance, compared to less than a quarter under the previous DLA system. She says the change was not sneaked out. It was in a written ministerial statement to parliament. She says the social security advisory committee can look at this. She says the work and pensions secretary called the committee when this was introduced and told them about it. Andrew Bridgen, a Conservative, asks about Copeland. Was that an endorsement of May\u2019s plans to have a strong economy and leave the EU? May says the historic result in Copeland was an endorsement her plans to keep the economy strong and to help places like Copeland that have suffered from years of neglect under Labour. And it was an endorsement of her strong leadership, in contrast to Labour\u2019s chaos. Theresa May starts by wishing people a happy St David\u2019s day. And she also pays tribute to Sir Gerald Kaufman, who died at the weekend. He was an outstanding parliamentarian, she says. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs asking questions. A Labour source has been briefing on the economic equality bill proposed by Sarah Champion today. (See 11.10am.) She says it would not stipulate that economic spending had to be divided 50/50 between men and women. Instead it would introduce transparency measures that highlighted who was benefiting from tax and spending measures, so as to push policy making towards equality. But the source stressed that the details had yet to be finalised, and that the party would consult on this over the next 12 months. She also stressed that this was not just about gender equality, and that it would look at the impact of economic inequality on LGBT people, BME people and people with disabilities too. We don\u2019t have a Labour leadership contest this year (yet?), but a proxy contest of sorts is under way at the Unite union where Len McCluskey, the general secretary and leading Jeremy Corbyn supporter, is standing for re-election and fighting off a challenge from an opponent who says McCluskey has spent too much time propping up the Labour leader. And this morning McCluskey has announced some good news for his campaign. He says 1,185 Unite branches, 80% of those who have nominated someone, have backed him for leader. Gerard Coyne, McCluskey\u2019s main challenger (who has accused McCluskey of medding too much in Labour politics, got just 187 branch nominations. Ian Allinson, who is challenging McCluskey from the left, got just 76 branch nominations. Commenting on the figures McCluskey said: I am honoured to have received the nomination of so many Unite branches across the UK, working in all sectors of the economy. This incredible level of backing is a vindication of what our great union has achieved for working people under my leadership. It is also a rejection of the cynical approach of one opponent, which is not to offer a positive vision for our union but to taint it with smears and do the bidding of meddlers from outside our union who would rather destroy Unite than see it provide strength and hope for working people. This huge vote of confidence in my leadership demonstrates members want the union to remain proud, democratic and independent of outside interference. Branch nominations are not inevitably an accurate guide to the final election result, because they get decided by the activists who turn up for meetings, but in union elections turnout is often very low - it was just 15% in 2013, when McCluskey was last elected general secretary - and these figures suggest that, as long as voting is dominated by activists, McCluskey should win comfortably. A memo leaked two months ago revealed that Coyne\u2019s supporters think he will only be able to win if he can get turnout above 20%. UPDATED: I\u2019ve corrected the post above to say that McCluskey won the support of 80% of Unite branches that nominated a candidate, not 80% of all Unite branches. Many Unite branches did not nominate anyone. At the weekend Jeremy Corbyn complained that Britain\u2019s \u201cwonderful media\u201d were not reporting properly what Labour has to say about policy. Some of us felt this was a little unfair, because Labour\u2019s policy output has not been especially rich recently, but this morning Sarah Champion, the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, has come out with a policy speech with some profound implications. You can read it in full here. And here are the key points. Champion said Labour would use an economic equality bill to stop budgets favouring men. For reasons she explained in her speech (see below), she said budget policy making needed \u201cfundamental, structural\u201d change because the current system meant spending decisions disproportionately favoured men. She said: I am pleased announce today that Labour will build upon current equalities legislation, consulting over the next 12 months on bringing in an economic equality bill. Put simply, this bill would seek to ensure that on equality, the money follows the policy. It will no longer be possible for governments to talk the talk on equality while implementing economic policies that make life harder for women and protected groups. It\u2019s about ensuring that we eliminate intrinsic, structural barriers that prevent people from reaching their full economic potential. She said that since 2010 86% of the losses created by tax rises and benefit cuts have affected women not men. She said this figure included the impact of measures in last year\u2019s autumn statement. Before the autumn statement the figure was 81%, she said. There is more information about the equality impact of the autumn statement in this House of Commons briefing paper. She urged the government to adopt \u201cgender budgeting\u201d. At its heart, we expect a budget that works for women as it is a key opportunity for the advancement of gender equality. This concept, often referred to as gender budgeting, now takes place in more than 40 countries around the world. It was originally inspired by the early experiences of countries such as Australia, and then given further momentum by the United Nations commitment to gender budgeting in the Beijing platform for action. In an article this week the Economist has also come out strongly in favour of \u201cgender budgeting\u201d. Here is the Economist leader on the subject, and here is the Economist\u2019s news story about what it involves. She explained why conventional government accounting disadvantages women. Women are particularly vulnerable to being hit harder by this Government policies, for a number of reasons. First, social security payments make up a greater share of women\u2019s income than men\u2019s, as women still earn less in the labour market. Women make greater use of public sector care services than men, because they have greater caring responsibilities. Women also pay less direct tax than men, because they tend to earn less. Meaning that tax breaks for top earners disproportionately benefit men. Finally, women are hit harder by this Government\u2019s policies, because a higher proportion of women are employed in the public sector, which is consistently under attack. She said conventional definitions of investment also disadvantage women. Currently, the wages of construction workers paid to build a school count as public investment. However, when government staffs the school to provide education, the wages of the teachers are not counted as investment expenditure, but as current expenditure. The benefits produced by teachers accrue over the years, both to the children who have been educated, and to the wider economy. These are not just \u2018day to day\u2019 immediate benefits. Feminist economists have long argued that the work force is a produced asset that requires investment of resources for it to be available on a daily basis. She said government\u2019s should produce their own gender impact analysis of financial statements, instead of relying on others, like the House of Commons library, to carry out this analysis. She ridiculed the government\u2019s record on cutting the deficit. When the UK Labour government invested in creating the NHS in 1948, the ratio of debt to GDP was over 200 per cent, and that higher public investment led to higher growth. High debt ratios did not prompt cuts to public investment in the 1940s, 1950s or 1960s. What is unarguable is that at the same time as imposing cruel spending cuts that have been shown to hit women hardest, this government has added almost \u00a3700bn to the national debt. That\u2019s not just more than the last Labour government. It\u2019s more than every Labour government, in history, added together! Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, was on the Today programme this morning renewing his call for Douglas Carswell, the party\u2019s only MP, to be expelled from the party. My colleague Matthew Weaver has the details. Here is his story. And here is how it starts. Ukip\u2019s former leader Nigel Farage, has accused the party\u2019s only MP of preventing it from becoming a radical anti-immigration party. In an increasingly hostile war of words with Douglas Carswell, Farage said the Clacton MP who defected from the Conservatives to Ukip in 2014, had undermined his attempts to equate EU membership with increased levels of immigration. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme amid reports that Carswell is in talks with the Tories about switching back, Farage said: \u201cThe time has now come to have a clean break. To make sure we don\u2019t have influences like Carswell taking us away from the key arguments like immigration.\u201d \u201cThere have been some in Ukip who want to turn us into a mainstream political party with very bland messages and I would say Ukip is a radical party or it is nothing.\u201d The Daily Telegraph says this morning that Carswell has been speaking to Conservative MPs about the possibility of returning to the party which he belonged to when first elected as an MP and until he defected to Ukip in 2014. Carswell has responded this morning by telling the Press Association: \u201cI\u2019m 100% Ukip.\u201d In an article in the Telegraph Daniel Hannan, the Conservative MEP and a close friend of Carswell\u2019s, says Farage should stop worrying about Carswell because they both got what they wanted; the leave side won. Hannan says: For Douglas, all that mattered was recovering our national independence. He saw Nigel\u2019s sallies into breast-feeding mothers, HIV-infected immigrants and the like as distractions. He came to the view that Nigel was more interested in hogging the limelight than in winning the referendum. He therefore worked, successfully, to ensure that Vote Leave, the mainstream campaign, prevailed. Yesterday, Nigel again attacked him for doing so - even though Douglas\u2019s choice was surely vindicated by the result. Three weeks ago my colleague Martin Kettle reported that Donald Trump\u2019s planned state visit to the UK was being scheduled for late summer or early autumn, not early summer as some reports had suggested, and that it would take place when parliament was in recess, so as to neutralise the impact of John Bercow, the Commons speaker, refusing to allow him to give a speech in Westminster Hall. With parliament in recess, such an invitation would be impossible anyway. Today the Sun has a story with a bit more detail about the possible timing. Tom Newton Dunn, the paper\u2019s political editor, says President Trump agreed to put back the visit a bit when he spoke to Theresa May on the phone two weeks ago because he wanted to reduce the chance of protests. Donald Trump\u2019s state visit to Britain has been delayed until October in a bid to avoid protests and MPs\u2019 snubs ... Though the dates may change again, a provisional three day slot for the president\u2019s formal visit has been pencilled in from October 5 to 8, The Sun has learned. The Thursdsay to Sunday slot falls just after the Tories\u2019 annual party conference but before Parliament returns from a recess \u2013 allowing Trump to bypass having to make any address to protesting MPs. A senior government source said: \u201cTrump still really wants to come this year, but he wants the heat to die down a bit first. \u201cThe White House watch what happens over here surprisingly closely, and they don\u2019t want to create a scene for our sake either.\u201d Number 10 are not denying the story, although officially all they are saying is that dates for the trip will be announced \u201cin due course\u201d. One source disputed the claim that the visit had been \u201cpostponed\u201d on the grounds on the grounds that an early date for the visit had never been agreed in the first place. Given the protests that have already taken place against Trump in the UK, the idea that putting the visit back to October will avoid \u201ca scene\u201d seems like heroic wishful thinking. And, while we\u2019re on the subject of heroic wishful thinking, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, has provided another example. Today\u2019s main story will be the Lords debate and vote on an amendment to the article 50 bill that would ensure that the rights of EU nationals who want to remain in the UK after Brexit are guaranteed now and her plea to the Lords to back the government seems set to be ignored. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: Liz Truss, the justice secretary and lord chancellor, gives evidence to the Lords constitution committee about the role of the lord chancellor in relation to the judiciary. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 3.30pm: Peers resume their debate on the article 50 bill. Later the government is expected to lose a vote on an amendment saying the government should given an assurance now that EU nationals in the UK will be able to stay after Brexit. I will be covering PMQs and the Lords debate in detail but, as usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary after PMQs and another in the afternoon. You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Western Australian employment agencies are well below the national average in official quality measurements, with their Queensland counterparts also below par in most regions. A Guardian Australia analysis of the December quarter of JobActive star ratings reveals that job service providers in Western Australia and Queensland are the worst performing in the country. The performance and evaluation of employment agencies \u2013 which help jobseekers find work in 1,700 locations around Australia \u2013 will be scrutinised at Senate estimates on Thursday. Every quarter the federal employment department generates a one-to-five star rating for all providers and locations using criteria such as whether jobseekers are in work within 12 and 26 weeks. According to the analysis, JobActive providers in WA averaged just 1.36 stars, compared with 2.95 for Queensland and the national average of 3.11. In WA, the worst outcomes were in Geraldton, Broome and the great southern/wheatbelt region where providers received just one star on average. In Perth providers also averaged below two stars, with an average of 1.59 in Perth north and 1.39 in Perth south. In Queensland, results below the national average were recorded in Fitzroy (1.76), Wivenhoe (2.34), Mackay (2.6), Brisbane south-east (2.86), the Darling Downs (2.94), and Somerset (2.98). Star ratings are generated by comparing individual sites\u2019 employment outcomes to the national average. A one-star rating equates to scores 40% below the national average; a two-star rating means scores of between 15% and 39% below the national average. The ratings control for differences between labour markets and jobseekers by using regression analysis \u201cto allow for fair comparison of employment providers\u2019 performances across the country\u201d, the employment department says. Under this system, the department estimates expected outcome rates for each employment provider and then compares the actual outcomes to generate the star rating. Nationally 33% of sites are one or two stars and 67% are three, four or five stars. All other states and territories had scores above the national average: New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory (3.41), Victoria (3.13), South Australia (3.26), Tasmania (3.66) and the Northern Territory (3.45). In NSW, regions below the national average included: far west Orana (including Broken Hill) with 2.13, the central west (2.34) and Sydney north and west (2.70). In Victoria, north-western Melbourne (2.24), Ballarat (2.33), Gippsland (2.65) and inner metro Melbourne (2.77) were below the average. The shadow employment services minister, Ed Husic, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe performance of JobActive providers, according to the government\u2019s own star ratings, is completely unsatisfactory and the employment minister needs to show what steps are being taken to fix this. \u201cMany regions across WA have an average rating of just one or two stars. This means nearly all the sites in those regions fall below the department\u2019s own mark for requiring review.\u201d The chief executive of the National Employment Services Association, Sally Sinclair, told Guardian Australia the results were an \u201canomaly\u201d. \u201cIn 16 years I\u2019ve never seen a distribution like this,\u201d she said, in reference to WA and Queensland lagging so far behind the rest of the country. Sinclair suggested the ratings system may not have properly accounted for the \u201crapid adjustment and paradigm shift\u201d in the WA jobs market. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can say it\u2019s necessarily provider performance when 18 months ago these providers were selected [for WA contracts] because of their track record.\u201d The providers with the lowest ratings in WA were: Atwork Australia, Communicare, MAX Employment, the Salvation Army Employment Plus, the Employment Services Group, Mission Providence, and Skill Hire WA. All were contacted for comment. A spokeswoman for the employment department said: \u201cThe variability in JobActive star ratings is due to ratings reflecting provider performance relative to the national average, rather than absolute benchmarks. \u201cA rating of one star indicates that a site\u2019s performance is below the national average, but this does not necessarily mean that the services provided are of low quality.\u201d She said the employment department was undertaking a national review of providers which could reallocate work away from poorer performing providers. The department spokeswoman suggested the use of averages was \u201cinaccurate\u201d because a four-star site was not twice as good as a two-star one. It would be \u201cmore robust\u201d to analyse the percentage of sites in each rating category, despite the fact both methods convey the higher proportion of one- and two-star ratings in Queensland and WA.",

Ralf Speth, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, said: \u201cThe expansion of our product range and building this British-designed and engineered car in the UK is a sign of our confidence in British manufacturing. \u201cWe are leading the global premium car industry with our commitment to our home market, and our heart, soul and headquarters will always be in the UK.\u201d The UK car industry backed the remain campaign in last year\u2019s EU referendum, and has since warned that British manufacturing is at risk of \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d if companies choose to invest in other countries after the Brexit vote. Japanese carmaker Nissan announced in October it would go ahead and build the next Qashqai and X-Trail models at its Sunderland factory. But the company\u2019s boss Carlos Ghosn said in January that the plant\u2019s competitiveness would be reviewed once the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU was settled. The Velar is on display at the Design Museum in London until 6 March, and will make its global motor show debut in Geneva next week. The starting price will be \u00a345,000 in the UK, positioning it between the Evoque \u2013 the least expensive Range Rover \u2013 and the Range Rover Sport. It is the third model in two years to be launched at the West Midlands plant. The decision follows a \u00a31.5bn investment in new facilities and technologies at the Solihull factory, where about 10,000 people are employed. JLR, owned by India\u2019s Tata, said it directly supports more than 40,000 British jobs at manufacturing plants and a further 250,000 in the supply chain. Last year the company JLR 583,313 cars, 44% of which were Range Rovers. The company also has manufacturing plants in Brazil, China and India and is building a factory in Slovakia.",

      "body": "<p>As a parent of a person with \u201cspecial needs\u201d, and now a voluntary worker supporting families with the same disability, I feel I have every right to comment (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/24/parents-pushing-for-special-needs-diagnosis-for-children-survey-says\" title=\"\">Parents too quick to seek special needs label, 24 February</a>). The system must be at fault if \u201clobbying parents\u201d are winning because pressure leads to a misdiagnosis and \u201cgenuine sufferers are losing out\u201d. Parents like myself have to battle for a diagnosis against impenetrable barriers. Professionals cannot have the same understanding of a child\u2019s needs and difficulties as a parent, yet feel able to ignore them.</p> <p>Many of the parents we support are accused of poor parenting and do not receive a diagnosis until a crisis occurs. Most have to fight tooth and nail to \u201cprove\u201d their child\u2019s disability. This can entail seeking second and third opinions, only to finally have their autism spectrum disorder confirmed. The heartache, time, effort and stress involved is exhausting. Few parents choose that path to \u201cseek a label\u201d in order to \u201cblame\u201d their child\u2019s disability. They simply want recognition and appreciation of their child\u2019s difference. They go in search of acceptance, inclusion, empathy and not criticism, blame and exclusion.</p> <p>Teachers have probably 30 children to consider in most classes. In the secondary phase, they may see a child for an hour\u2019s lesson and the emphasis is on examination results. Individuals easily get lost. Many teachers can and do address basic behavioural issues effectively. However, even students with an accepted diagnosis, on the register of special needs, are not acknowledged as requiring specialist, differentiated support or materials. Training of teachers can be limited too. I have listened with horror, and intervened, regarding information on Asperger\u2019s which has simply been incorrect. <br /><strong>Ann Moore</strong><br /><em>Stocksfield, Northumberland</em></p> <p>\u2022 There\u2019s a good reason why middle-class parents are better able to get a special needs diagnosis for their child: cash. There is a dire shortage of educational psychologists in local authorities, and children can expect a wait of at least a year to see one for a diagnosis. I advise everyone coming to me to get an assessment privately if they can. But it\u2019s nonsense to suggest these children get an unwarranted diagnosis \u2013 assessments are scrupulous and no one gets extra time in exams or any other advantage without this official recognition.</p> <p>We need to be concerned instead about the poorer kids who don\u2019t have this option. The teachers\u2019 union ATL says that at least 200,000 children are slipping through the net following government reforms in 2014, which saw the proportion of children identified with SEN cut from 20% to 15% \u2013 when, sadly, there was no widespread miracle. And support in schools for special needs is one of the biggest casualties as budgets are slashed.<br /><strong>Bernadette John</strong><br /><em>SEN director, The Good Schools Guide</em></p> <p><strong>\u2022<em> Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong>\u2022<em> Read more Guardian letters \u2013 </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>click here to visit gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "As a parent of a person with \u201cspecial needs\u201d, and now a voluntary worker supporting families with the same disability, I feel I have every right to comment (Parents too quick to seek special needs label, 24 February). The system must be at fault if \u201clobbying parents\u201d are winning because pressure leads to a misdiagnosis and \u201cgenuine sufferers are losing out\u201d. Parents like myself have to battle for a diagnosis against impenetrable barriers. Professionals cannot have the same understanding of a child\u2019s needs and difficulties as a parent, yet feel able to ignore them. Many of the parents we support are accused of poor parenting and do not receive a diagnosis until a crisis occurs. Most have to fight tooth and nail to \u201cprove\u201d their child\u2019s disability. This can entail seeking second and third opinions, only to finally have their autism spectrum disorder confirmed. The heartache, time, effort and stress involved is exhausting. Few parents choose that path to \u201cseek a label\u201d in order to \u201cblame\u201d their child\u2019s disability. They simply want recognition and appreciation of their child\u2019s difference. They go in search of acceptance, inclusion, empathy and not criticism, blame and exclusion. Teachers have probably 30 children to consider in most classes. In the secondary phase, they may see a child for an hour\u2019s lesson and the emphasis is on examination results. Individuals easily get lost. Many teachers can and do address basic behavioural issues effectively. However, even students with an accepted diagnosis, on the register of special needs, are not acknowledged as requiring specialist, differentiated support or materials. Training of teachers can be limited too. I have listened with horror, and intervened, regarding information on Asperger\u2019s which has simply been incorrect. Ann Moore Stocksfield, Northumberland \u2022 There\u2019s a good reason why middle-class parents are better able to get a special needs diagnosis for their child: cash. There is a dire shortage of educational psychologists in local authorities, and children can expect a wait of at least a year to see one for a diagnosis. I advise everyone coming to me to get an assessment privately if they can. But it\u2019s nonsense to suggest these children get an unwarranted diagnosis \u2013 assessments are scrupulous and no one gets extra time in exams or any other advantage without this official recognition. We need to be concerned instead about the poorer kids who don\u2019t have this option. The teachers\u2019 union ATL says that at least 200,000 children are slipping through the net following government reforms in 2014, which saw the proportion of children identified with SEN cut from 20% to 15% \u2013 when, sadly, there was no widespread miracle. And support in schools for special needs is one of the biggest casualties as budgets are slashed.

The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers\u2019 Union said more than 600 jobs were at risk at nine Greggs bakeries around the UK.

The move has already led to the loss of 355 manufacturing jobs after the closure of bakeries in Twickenham, Edinburgh and Sleaford.

Walkers said 80% of the Peterlee factory\u2019s output was shipped to customers south of the local area, incurring significant transport costs. Tracey Foster, Peterlee manufacturing director at PepsiCo UK, said: \u201cPeterlee has been an important site for our business but the changes we are proposing present significant productivity and efficiency savings crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainable growth of our business in the UK.\u201d Both Greggs and Walkers denied the cost savings were linked to rising costs linked to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote.

But he did acknowledge the changes would help offset rising costs resulting from the introduction of the new minimum wage for over-25s, the apprenticeship levy and increases in commodities such as dairy goods and meat. Boots plans to close 220 of its 320 photo labs. Consultation with affected staff began on Wednesday and is expected to be completed in the summer. Photo lab staff will be offered retraining and redeployment to other roles where possible, but some roles may be made redundant. Boots said: \u201cOver the past few years, customers\u2019 expectations of photo services have continued to change as they print fewer pictures but want to create more personalised photo gifts and items such as personalised photobooks, canvases and cards.

Timpson Group, the shoe-mending company, is also expanding into photo gifts and processing. The company, which owns Snappy Snaps and bought Tesco\u2019s photo processing business in 2014 (it now operates under the Max Spielmann brand), opened 10 more photo outlets last year. Boots said customers who no longer had access to a photo lab in their local store would be able to send films away for developing at its head office in Nottingham, which also produces photo-based gifts. It will also still be possible to print photographs directly from phones, tablet computers or USB sticks at 3,000 automated kiosks across 1,000 Boots stores.",

How bad has it become?</strong></p> <p><strong>Kate Grenville: </strong>The moment I\u2019d really realised I\u2019d gone beyond eccentric about all this was at a hotel in Launceston. The corridor outside my hotel room was very strongly fragranced with those reeds in bottles \u2013 I think they\u2019re called diffusers \u2013 and the smell was coming in through the crack around the door. I realised I was going to have a miserable night with a headache unless I could do something about it, so I went out and found a newsagent to buy a roll of packaging tape. When all the book business was done for the night, I taped all around the door to seal myself in like a pharaoh in a tomb. </p> <p>I thought: \u201cThis is crazy, I have entered some kind of planet crazy.

Many people get headaches like I do, but other people know their asthma is triggered by it, [or have] other respiratory problems \u2013 like their throat closes up or they start coughing or sneezing \u2013 or they feel sick to the stomach when they smell fragrance.</p> <p>The next surprise was to find modern perfumes are mostly not made from flowers. Virtually all fragrances \u2013 whether very expensive in little tiny bottles, or the stuff you put in the toilet to make it smell nice \u2013 they are all made from chemicals.<br /></p> <p>The surprise after that was that fragrance manufacturers don\u2019t have to declare all their ingredients, so on the one hand they can make stuff cheaply from synthetics, and on the other they don\u2019t have to tell us. The cocktail that makes up a fragrance is considered a \u201ctrade secret\u201d, and that\u2019s why they are exempt from the labelling laws.<br /></p> <p><strong>Have you noticed any difference on your current tour in the scent of your fans? Are they getting the message and toning it down for you?<br /></strong></p> <p>They are; it is fantastic. Last book tour I had a headache every single time I stood up in front of a group of people. This time it only happened once, probably from a cab I took to the venue. The publicist is putting on the bottom of all the invitations it would be appreciated if you could refrain from wearing perfume to this event. It has made such a difference to me, I\u2019m so grateful.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>Given that this has worked out so well for you, are there any issues you are encountering on this tour that might inspire the next book? </strong><br /></p> <p>I want to get back to writing a novel. This book was a departure for me, I\u2019ve never tried science writing, this was fuelled by my own interest in the subject. I made a decision to only to use published science, peer-reviewed \u2013 the internet is full of rubbish about fragrance and every other subject. I had to learn how to read proper science. I enjoyed it but I needed a lot of help, and the next book is going to be another novel.<br /></p> <p><strong>Any hints on what it might be about?</strong><br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/10/the-secret-river-review-a-masterful-portrayal-of-australias-dark-past\">The Secret River review \u2013\u00a0a masterful portrayal of Australia's dark past</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Let me just say I am still just as fascinated about the early days of white settlement in Australia. I think there are many stories that haven\u2019t been told, we\u2019ve only just scratched the surface. We still live with a lot of often rather self-congratulatory myths about those times.<br /></p> <p><strong>Your visit to South Australia will coincide with the Adelaide festival run of the theatrical adaptation of your novel The Secret River. What is it like to have your work reinterpreted for another medium? Have you had any involvement in this play?</strong><br /></p> <p>I haven\u2019t, no. When the team that adapted the play took it on, I had a short meeting with them and I said: \u201cPlease don\u2019t give me a faithful adaptation. A play has to be a completely different experience, please just write a good play.\u201d<br /></p> <p>They did that a hundredfold. Andrew Bovell wrote it brilliantly, Neil Armfield and Stephen Page conceptualised and directed it. I am so proud that my work has resulted in a very different kind of experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bcbe8ece30a6511a24fb45049323bf08e733e10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bcbe8ece30a6511a24fb45049323bf08e733e10/0_0_1200_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ningali Lawford Wolf in The Secret River at Anstey Hill Quarry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ningali Lawford-Wolf in The Secret River at Anstey Hill quarry in Adelaide.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shane Reid</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>A key difference between the book and the play is the inclusion of Aboriginal voices in the production. You originally wrote dialogue for the Aboriginal characters in the novel but decided in the end they weren\u2019t your stories to tell and so it would be better not to attempt to represent them. What do you think of the decision to do so in the play?</strong></p> <p>With the book I just thought I was stepping into a world that I didn\u2019t know enough to write about. I could imagine my way into the white settlers\u2019 world, but the Aboriginal world \u2013 I felt first of all it wasn\u2019t my place to tell that story, and it is extremely difficult given that not to fall into traps. So I made the decision to make it very clear the Aboriginal story was there to be told.</p> <p>I think of it as like a hollow in the middle of the novel, which is where the Aboriginal story is; like I\u2019ve drawn an edge around it in order to say to people: \u201cLook, there is a story to be told here about the Aboriginal people whose story this also is, but it is not my place to tell it.\u201d<br /></p> <p>When the team got together to put it on the stage, they were able to make a different decision. What I realised the first time I saw it was that this is truly a shared moment of theatre: it\u2019s about two families, a black family and a white family, trying to occupy the same part of the planet. The Aboriginal characters are speaking in Dharug. The first time you hear them, and realise there are not going to be subtitles, you are in the same position as the white characters on stage \u2013 in other words you are watching someone talk to you and have no idea what they are saying. The audience can then see the enormous gulf of misunderstanding that happened, and will always happen.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d5d22e78c339a1a4ac49f31e008ae0dc6a73607\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d5d22e78c339a1a4ac49f31e008ae0dc6a73607/0_0_800_1200/667.jpg\" alt=\"Jaydan Bush, Stephen Goldsmith, Dylan Miller in The Secret River\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve seen the play many times and I cry every time \u2013 I expect this time to be even more emotional.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shane Reid</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To me it was a stroke of theatrical genius to properly acknowledge the Aboriginal reality there, and give it spoken form in Dharug language.<br /></p> <p><strong>The play will be performed outside, at Anstey Hill quarry. What do you think the setting will add to the performance? If you could choose where people read the book, where would you like them to do so?<br /></strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve never seen the quarry in Adelaide, but it just looks from the photograph as if it will be an amazing experience to be out in the Australian landscape at night to watch this play, given landscape and country is what it is all about. In Aboriginal culture it is the whole foundation of the spiritual life, and it is what the conflict is about \u2013 actual country, whose country is it, how can we go about sharing it \u2013 that\u2019s the central issue. To be literally sitting on country will be an amazing and rather humbling experience. I\u2019ve seen the play many times and I cry every time \u2013 I expect this time to be even more emotional.<br /></p> <p>As for where I\u2019d like people to read the book, the thing about a book is you invent the landscape as you read. Although I have to say one woman shortly after the book came out, a woman wrote to me and said: \u201cI was reading The Secret River on a boat going up the Hawkesbury, we hired a boat and decided to sail up the river.\u201d At one point [the book] actually went overboard, and she said: \u201cI was so bereft at the idea of losing it that I actually jumped overboard to rescue it before it sank.\u201d That\u2019s dedication for you.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/2017/AdelaideWritersWeek2017\">Adelaide writers\u2019 week</a> runs from 4 to 9 March at Pioneer Women\u2019s Memorial Garden. <a href=\"http://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/2017/thesecretriver\">The Secret River</a> is at Anstey Hill quarry in Adelaide until Sunday 19 March as part of <a href=\"http://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/\">Adelaide festival</a>.

I want to get back to writing a novel. This book was a departure for me, I\u2019ve never tried science writing, this was fuelled by my own interest in the subject. I made a decision to only to use published science, peer-reviewed \u2013 the internet is full of rubbish about fragrance and every other subject. I had to learn how to read proper science. I enjoyed it but I needed a lot of help, and the next book is going to be another novel. Any hints on what it might be about? Let me just say I am still just as fascinated about the early days of white settlement in Australia. I think there are many stories that haven\u2019t been told, we\u2019ve only just scratched the surface. We still live with a lot of often rather self-congratulatory myths about those times. Your visit to South Australia will coincide with the Adelaide festival run of the theatrical adaptation of your novel The Secret River. What is it like to have your work reinterpreted for another medium? Have you had any involvement in this play? I haven\u2019t, no. When the team that adapted the play took it on, I had a short meeting with them and I said: \u201cPlease don\u2019t give me a faithful adaptation. A play has to be a completely different experience, please just write a good play.\u201d They did that a hundredfold. Andrew Bovell wrote it brilliantly, Neil Armfield and Stephen Page conceptualised and directed it. I am so proud that my work has resulted in a very different kind of experience. A key difference between the book and the play is the inclusion of Aboriginal voices in the production. You originally wrote dialogue for the Aboriginal characters in the novel but decided in the end they weren\u2019t your stories to tell and so it would be better not to attempt to represent them. What do you think of the decision to do so in the play? With the book I just thought I was stepping into a world that I didn\u2019t know enough to write about. I could imagine my way into the white settlers\u2019 world, but the Aboriginal world \u2013 I felt first of all it wasn\u2019t my place to tell that story, and it is extremely difficult given that not to fall into traps. So I made the decision to make it very clear the Aboriginal story was there to be told. I think of it as like a hollow in the middle of the novel, which is where the Aboriginal story is; like I\u2019ve drawn an edge around it in order to say to people: \u201cLook, there is a story to be told here about the Aboriginal people whose story this also is, but it is not my place to tell it.\u201d When the team got together to put it on the stage, they were able to make a different decision. What I realised the first time I saw it was that this is truly a shared moment of theatre: it\u2019s about two families, a black family and a white family, trying to occupy the same part of the planet. The Aboriginal characters are speaking in Dharug. The first time you hear them, and realise there are not going to be subtitles, you are in the same position as the white characters on stage \u2013 in other words you are watching someone talk to you and have no idea what they are saying. The audience can then see the enormous gulf of misunderstanding that happened, and will always happen. To me it was a stroke of theatrical genius to properly acknowledge the Aboriginal reality there, and give it spoken form in Dharug language. The play will be performed outside, at Anstey Hill quarry. What do you think the setting will add to the performance? If you could choose where people read the book, where would you like them to do so? I\u2019ve never seen the quarry in Adelaide, but it just looks from the photograph as if it will be an amazing experience to be out in the Australian landscape at night to watch this play, given landscape and country is what it is all about. In Aboriginal culture it is the whole foundation of the spiritual life, and it is what the conflict is about \u2013 actual country, whose country is it, how can we go about sharing it \u2013 that\u2019s the central issue. To be literally sitting on country will be an amazing and rather humbling experience. I\u2019ve seen the play many times and I cry every time \u2013 I expect this time to be even more emotional. As for where I\u2019d like people to read the book, the thing about a book is you invent the landscape as you read. Although I have to say one woman shortly after the book came out, a woman wrote to me and said: \u201cI was reading The Secret River on a boat going up the Hawkesbury, we hired a boat and decided to sail up the river.\u201d At one point [the book] actually went overboard, and she said: \u201cI was so bereft at the idea of losing it that I actually jumped overboard to rescue it before it sank.\u201d That\u2019s dedication for you. \u2022 Adelaide writers\u2019 week runs from 4 to 9 March at Pioneer Women\u2019s Memorial Garden. The Secret River is at Anstey Hill quarry in Adelaide until Sunday 19 March as part of Adelaide festival. Kate Grenville will also speak at The Secret River festival forum at the Riverbank Palais on 7 March",

Stephen Evans, the campaigns director of the National Secular Society, said: \u201cThis sounds like children from minority faith groups will be totally left behind by the government\u2019s proposals. Under this approach, children who happen to be born into conservative religious groups will still be without proper sex and relationships education.\u201d The British Humanist Association said the announcement was a step in the right direction, but added that the government should ensure children in faith schools were not deprived of age-appropriate sex and relationships education. The BHA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Copson, said: \u201cA child\u2019s access to accurate, evidence-based and relevant information, designed for the simple purpose of keeping them safe, should not be dependent on their religious or non-religious background, nor on the type of school to which they happen to have been sent. It should be clear to everyone that either all children have a right to this education, or no such right exists.\u201d The government will now make the change by tabling its own amendment to the children and social work bill, having previously been under pressure when more than two dozen Tory MPs signed their own backbench amendment to the bill, spearheaded by former women and equalities secretary Maria Miller. Miller said the change showed the government had listened to \u201cthe overwhelming majority of parents and children\u201d who were clear they wanted relationship and sex education to be a compulsory part of every child\u2019s education. David Burrowes, the Tory MP leading the reforms, said of the announcement: \u201cIt\u2019s a victory for our cross-party, cross-interests coalition but above all it\u2019s a victory for parents and children, and those vulnerable children who most need support to build healthy relationships.\u201d The Department for Education announcement was, said Cooper, \u201cthe right result for millions of children and teenagers who too often are exposed to things like bullying, sexting, revenge pornography or violence in teenage relationships and need support\u201d.",

It\u2019s a notion Hazen takes issue with, suggesting a new category is needed since many modern mineral-like materials, from laser crystals to components of cement, will also be adding to the complex array of novel minerals that archaeologists of the future might unearth. \u201cImagine finding a solid waste dump where people throw away lots of computers and other electronic devices \u2013 you\u2019ll have semiconductor chips and magnets and motors and all the metallic pieces and even speciality glasses with phosphors and so forth,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 100bn years, if someone comes back to Earth and looks at that land, they are really not going to be thinking \u2018oh, this one is not a mineral or this one is a mineral\u2019, they are just basically going to find these unusual crystalline compounds that form a distinctive marker layer,\u201d Hazen added. Jan Zalasiewicz, professor of palaeobiology at the University of Leicester and chair of the Working Group on the Anthropocene (WGA), said the new catalogue was an excellent study. \u201cIt does add significantly to the characterisation of the Anthropocene \u2013 not least because there is little that is more fundamental to rock strata than the minerals they are composed of,\u201d he said. While the exact onset of the Anthropocene is a moot point, with the dawn of thermonuclear weapons tests currently the favourite marker, Zalasiewicz says the new catalogue could also prove valuable in distinguishing the epoch. \u201cThe WGA is now putting together a wide range of physical, chemical and biological data on the Anthropocene in preparation for a formal proposal to include it into the Geological Time Scale,\u201d he said. \u201cThe features selected to define it will ultimately be those that provide the sharpest and clearest boundary for practical recognition by geologists. The mineral evidence will certainly be borne in mind as we\u2019re considering this.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The federal government\u2019s inaction on payday loans is allowing unscrupulous lenders to continue to exploit vulnerable Australians, consumer advocates say. The federal government last year committed to strengthening protections for consumers from payday loans, a form of high-interest cash advance provided by companies such as Cash Converters. The government\u2019s commitment followed an independent review of small amount credit contract regulations, which found payday loans were being inappropriately handed to low-income and vulnerable Australians. Those individuals were often unable to afford loan repayments and exorbitant fees, causing many to become trapped in a debt cycle. But, despite expected bipartisan support, the government has still not acted on its promise. The Consumer Law Advocacy Centre\u2019s senior policy officer, Katherine Temple, said the delays were allowing lenders to continue to target vulnerable Australians. \u201cWe can\u2019t see any reason why the government is still sitting on its hands,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, we can\u2019t afford to wait to make these changes. We\u2019re seeing people caught in debt spirals in these loans. \u201cThey\u2019re not being used as a one-off stopgap measure, they\u2019re being used as a repeat source of easy cash at extremely high rates of interest.\u201d Last year\u2019s review urged the government to cap the amount of payday loan repayments to 10% of a person\u2019s net income. It also recommended that lenders be prevented from bombarding borrowers with continued offers of credit after they have taken out an initial loan. A spokesman for the financial services minister, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, said legislation would be introduced this year. The government believes it will have bipartisan support for the changes. He noted there was already a bar on repeated offers where a consumer had two or more small amount loans within 90 days, but said the \u201cgovernment is moving toward a more protected regime\u201d. O\u2019Dwyer also issued a statement on Wednesday, saying the government was committed to strengthening consumer protections. \u201cThe government\u2019s changes will strengthen the protections available under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act,\u201d O\u2019Dwyer said. \u201cThe government has committed to progressing legislation this year and welcomes bipartisan support on this much needed reform.\u201d Short-term lending is a valuable market for lenders, and is predicted to be worth $2bn annually by 2018. Repeat borrowers made up 38% of payday loan recipients in 2015. Debate over Cash Converters\u2019 payday loans was reignited this week amid criticism of the outcome of an Asic investigation into the company\u2019s scheme. The corporate regulator found Cash Converters was lending to vulnerable Australians without properly checking if they had the ability to repay. Cash Converters agreed to refund 118,000 small credit contracts worth $10.8m, and pay Asic $1.35m in fines. But the enforceable undertaking it agreed to with Asic did not include customers who had signed up for a loan in-store. It only related to loans applied for online. O\u2019Dwyer said the compensation program was the largest of its kind in Australia. She said those who were not eligible under the program could still seek redress through the credit and investments ombudsman, or make a separate complaint to Asic. \u201cThe ombudsman is free for all consumers to access, makes independent decisions and can award compensation of up to $309,000 per consumer,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "The progressive thinktank the Australia Institute has raised concerns about the operation of the Turnbull government\u2019s $5bn northern Australia infrastructure fund, saying the organisation lacks resources and is not being transparent about its internal procedures. With officials from the $5bn fund due to front Senate estimates hearings in Canberra on Thursday, the thinktank has released a report arguing the NAIF is behind other comparable government organisations in terms of process and disclosure, and in operational funding. The fund has been front-and-centre in national political debate, with the government flagging that it may invest in new infrastructure associated with the controversial Adani Group\u2019s $16.5bn coalmine, or in new coal-fired power generation. Last December the minister for resources and northern Australia, Matt Canavan, said the government had to \u201clook seriously\u201d at Adani\u2019s request for a loan to help build a $2.5bn railway to carry coal from the project to ports for export. He argued that building a common user railway would have wider benefits to the economy. In February Canavan also flagged subsidising a \u201cclean coal\u201d baseload power plant from the NAIF, and said the government had already heard from an interested party eyeing off economic development around the Adani project. Officials from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation told a Senate estimates hearing this week they had been approached last Friday by proponents of a new $1.2bn coal-fired power station with carbon capture and storage technology. But the outgoing CEFC chief executive, Oliver Yates, said he believed such a development was not financeable without the government agreeing to indemnify the project against the future risk of a carbon price being introduced and against the cost of delays in the project prompted by likely community protest action. The ABC subsequently revealed that the interested party was Clive Palmer\u2019s Waratah Coal company, which was intent on seeking government assistance to develop a \u201cclean coal\u201d plant in the Galilee basin. The NAIF now has four projects in due diligence but it is not clear what these projects are. The organisation is independent of the government, and officials in Canberra expect it to make recommendations to the government on specific investment projects over the course of this year. The Australia Institute made a number of requests under freedom of information laws seeking specific documentation about the fund\u2019s applications and approvals procedures, its credit policy guidelines, its risk appetite statement and its public benefit policy. The thinktank says inquiries for this material was knocked back on the basis that making the procedures transparent \u201cwould reveal to proponents and other interested parties the NAIF\u2019s methodologies beyond what is required or appropriate to disclose publicly\u201d. The NAIF refused to release certain documents because disclosure of the information \u201ccould provide certain parties with an advantage, and could cause proponents to alter their contact with the NAIF and possibly the content of their application, in a manner that makes it harder for the NAIF to objectively and accurately assess applications\u201d. The institute says the NAIF refused to say in response to the FoI requests whether or not it has any documents containing the key words \u201cAdani\u201d, \u201cGalilee basin\u201d or \u201cCarmichael\u201d. Tom Swann, the author of the report for the Australia Institute, said the NAIF\u2019s processes were opaque. \u201cKey policies are still missing and the publicly available guidance leaves much unclear,\u201d he said. \u201cHow will funds be prioritised? What scrutiny will be applied to the public interest requirement? How will negative impacts be considered? \u201cCompared to other comparable bodies, NAIF is behind in not only behind terms of process and disclosure, but it also its operational funding. It appears to be only a handful of staff.\u201d Swann said the government had put the organisation in a difficult position because it was attaching political urgency to projects and not backing the urgency up with appropriate resources.

      "body": "<p>The last NRL club to win back-to-back grand finals was Brisbane in 1992-93. And they were some footy side. Coached by Wayne Bennett, they trotted out an Origin-strength XVII including Allan Langer, Steve Renouf, Willie Carne, Glenn Lazarus, Kevin and Kerrod Walters, Trevor \u201cThe Axe\u201d Gillmeister, Chris Johns and Julian O\u2019Neill.</p> <p>But they still had to come from fifth in \u201993 to do it. And they did need to be lucky enough to (again) front a Dragons side whose firepower featured stick-legged wing Ian \u201cChook\u201d Herron and Graeme \u201cThe Penguin\u201d Bradley whose sole job in the centres was to test Renouf\u2019s dodgy jaw. Which he failed to accomplish.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/01/signs-point-to-intriguing-nrl-season-on-field-but-definitely-more-to-do-off-it\">Signs point to intriguing NRL season on field but definitely 'more to do' off it | Paul Connolly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since then we\u2019ve had a few what could be called \u201cmini-dynasties\u201d without a team going back-to-back.<br /></p> <p>Melbourne Storm have been closest, albeit with a club roster that needed two sets of books to fit in Greg Inglis, Israel Folau, Cooper Cronk, Cameron Smith, Billy Slater, Ryan Hoffman, Adam Blair, Matt King, Michael Crocker, Jeff Lima, Jeremy Smith and Matt Geyer. And there were others. Good ones.</p> <p>Storm reached the decider four years in a row, 2006-09, winning (the match if not the gong) in \u201907 and \u201909. Then came the trouble in 2010 and they played a season for zero points. They were minor premiers in 2011 but knocked out in the preliminary final, before vindication, of sorts \u2013 winning legally in 2012.</p> <p>But back-to-back, even with all that illicit firepower, they could not go.</p> <p>Des Hasler\u2019s Sea Eagles made the decider three years straight (\u201995-\u201997) in the middle of the fractious and not very super Super League years for one premiership.</p> <p>Ricky Stuart\u2019s Roosters held aloft one very heavy trophy bearing the likeness of Norm Provan hugging Arthur Summons in the middle of their club\u2019s mini-dynasty between 2001-03. And didn\u2019t they have some players: Brad Fittler, Craig Fitzgibbon, Craig Wing, Anthony Minichiello, Adrian Morley, Bryan Fletcher and you\u2019d be leaving out a few including Brett Mullins who was on the wing.</p> <p>But back-to-back? No. And so to season 2017 and recent history tells us that the Sharks will not win the 2017 premiership. Let us count the ways.</p> <p>The great mini-dynasties \u2013 Brisbane (\u201892-\u201993), Roosters (\u201901-\u201903), Manly (\u201995-\u201997) \u2013 all kept their best players. The greater nucleus of their squad, their spines, their star-power, hung around.<br /></p> <p>The Brisbane teams that contested the \u201992 and \u201993 grand finals were identical bar one spot on the bench: Peter Ryan the first year, Tony Currie the next. And that\u2019s it. The backline was identical. The forward pack swapped Mark Hohn and Gavin Allen starting and bench. Bennett calmly oversaw it all.<br /></p> <p>As for the longer dynasties, their success begat success. Players came to them. It was dodgy how they could fit them in but Storm in \u201906-\u201912 (and arguably going still) and the Canberra Raiders of \u201987-\u201994 not only kept their best players, they added very good ones. </p> <p>The Raiders of \u201994 had added David Furner, John Lomax, Quentin Pongia, Mullins and Ken Nagas to the nucleus of champions Mal Meninga, Brad Clyde, Ricky Stuart and Laurie Daley.</p> <p>And that mob did go back-to-back in \u201989 and \u201990, and made four grand finals, and the finals every year until Super League came along. But <em>that</em> was a dynasty.</p> <p>Cronulla, meanwhile, have lost players. Two of their best: fullback <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/02/ben-barba-joins-world-rugbys-top-earners-after-taking-up-toulon-offer\">Ben Barba is off to France</a> and hooker and middle-man manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/26/cronulla-veteran-michael-ennis-nrl-retirement\">Mick Ennis is off to the media</a>. In their place are workhorse Panthers big man Jeremy Latimore and crazy-horse Bulldogs enigma Tony Williams, fine footy players for sure \u2013 but spinal cord members they are not.</p> <p>In 2016 the Sharks welcomed James Maloney and Chad Townsend, their six and seven. The year before it was Ennis, Barba and the super utility Jack Bird. They built better. This year, not so much. </p> <p>The Roosters went into 2014 with many pundits predicting \u2013 from a look at their roster, which is effectively the only data set one can hold a looking glass upon \u2013 they had the best chance of going back-to-back since those Broncos of the previous millennia. </p> <p>They had lost only the often-penalised meat axe Luke O\u2019Donnell and the bench forward Martin Kennedy. They added Remi Casty (from Catalans), Jackson Hastings (Dragons) and Heath L\u2019Estrange (Bradford). Contracts were signed by Anthony Minichiello, Mitchell Pearce, Daniel Tupou, Mitch Aubusson, Daniel Mortimer, Frank-Paul Nuuausala and a certain Sonny Bill Williams.</p> <p>And they hummed on into 2014 and finished minor premiers. They lost their qualifying final by a point to Penrith Panthers, then won their semi-final against North Queensland 31-30 after leading 30-nil before half-time. A 76th minute Maloney field goal stayed the execution that would follow next week when they faced Souths who had run third, beaten Manly and had a break.<br /></p> <p>And there died Rooster dreams. In late 2015 they punted Maloney to the premiers, Sonny Bill took off and they\u2019ve been middling ever since.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/28/geoff-toovey-its-very-easy-to-pull-club-culture-apart\">Geoff Toovey: 'It\u2019s very easy to pull club culture apart'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>North Queensland Cowboys entered 2016 with, just like the Roosters before them, strongly tipped to emulate the Broncos. They had lost only the workhorse forward Glenn Hall. Yet they hadn\u2019t grown and they didn\u2019t add strength. Shaun Hudson came from Gold Coast Titans and Jahrome Hughes from Townsville Blackhawks. Hudson didn\u2019t get on the park. Hughes played one game and signed for Storm in June.</p> <p>Six of their players were bashed around in State of Origin, including their seemingly bash-proof champion Johnathan Thurston. They still finished fourth, a points-differential decision over their fellow grand finalists Brisbane Broncos who also had six Origin-battered players.<br /></p> <p>In the first final the Cows were beaten up by Melboune Storm at AAMI Park. The next one they tipped out the Broncos 26-20 in Townsville. And in week three they limped on down to Sydney and were rissoled by the premiers.</p> <p>Souths\u2019 defence of their title in 2015 began by losing Sam Burgess to Bath and Ben Te\u2019o to Leinster. Souths finished seventh. And that\u2019s all they\u2019d probably like to remember about that. They did win the Auckland Nines, though.</p> <p>And here we are. The Sharks defending the indefensible.</p> <p>Or is it? They do have James Maloney still, and he\u2019s a fun running gun. Valentine Holmes always wanted to play fullback and now gets his chance. Jack Bird will improve again. And to the meat of their forward pack comes Jeremy Latimore and Tony Williams.</p> <p>But Paul Gallen and Luke Lewis are blown calf from limping 26 rounds. And they\u2019ll be hard marked and studied by all the other clubs. And history is against them. And they haven\u2019t built on their success. Had they hung onto Ennis and Barba, you could say they were par, another top four chance and from there who knows.</p> <p>But these Sharks? History tell us it\u2019s going to be difficult to go back-to-back.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The last NRL club to win back-to-back grand finals was Brisbane in 1992-93. And they were some footy side. Coached by Wayne Bennett, they trotted out an Origin-strength XVII including Allan Langer, Steve Renouf, Willie Carne, Glenn Lazarus, Kevin and Kerrod Walters, Trevor \u201cThe Axe\u201d Gillmeister, Chris Johns and Julian O\u2019Neill. But they still had to come from fifth in \u201993 to do it. And they did need to be lucky enough to (again) front a Dragons side whose firepower featured stick-legged wing Ian \u201cChook\u201d Herron and Graeme \u201cThe Penguin\u201d Bradley whose sole job in the centres was to test Renouf\u2019s dodgy jaw. Which he failed to accomplish. Since then we\u2019ve had a few what could be called \u201cmini-dynasties\u201d without a team going back-to-back. Melbourne Storm have been closest, albeit with a club roster that needed two sets of books to fit in Greg Inglis, Israel Folau, Cooper Cronk, Cameron Smith, Billy Slater, Ryan Hoffman, Adam Blair, Matt King, Michael Crocker, Jeff Lima, Jeremy Smith and Matt Geyer. And there were others. Good ones. Storm reached the decider four years in a row, 2006-09, winning (the match if not the gong) in \u201907 and \u201909. Then came the trouble in 2010 and they played a season for zero points. They were minor premiers in 2011 but knocked out in the preliminary final, before vindication, of sorts \u2013 winning legally in 2012. But back-to-back, even with all that illicit firepower, they could not go. Des Hasler\u2019s Sea Eagles made the decider three years straight (\u201995-\u201997) in the middle of the fractious and not very super Super League years for one premiership. Ricky Stuart\u2019s Roosters held aloft one very heavy trophy bearing the likeness of Norm Provan hugging Arthur Summons in the middle of their club\u2019s mini-dynasty between 2001-03. And didn\u2019t they have some players: Brad Fittler, Craig Fitzgibbon, Craig Wing, Anthony Minichiello, Adrian Morley, Bryan Fletcher and you\u2019d be leaving out a few including Brett Mullins who was on the wing. But back-to-back? No. And so to season 2017 and recent history tells us that the Sharks will not win the 2017 premiership. Let us count the ways. The great mini-dynasties \u2013 Brisbane (\u201892-\u201993), Roosters (\u201901-\u201903), Manly (\u201995-\u201997) \u2013 all kept their best players. The greater nucleus of their squad, their spines, their star-power, hung around. The Brisbane teams that contested the \u201992 and \u201993 grand finals were identical bar one spot on the bench: Peter Ryan the first year, Tony Currie the next. And that\u2019s it. The backline was identical. The forward pack swapped Mark Hohn and Gavin Allen starting and bench. Bennett calmly oversaw it all. As for the longer dynasties, their success begat success. Players came to them. It was dodgy how they could fit them in but Storm in \u201906-\u201912 (and arguably going still) and the Canberra Raiders of \u201987-\u201994 not only kept their best players, they added very good ones. The Raiders of \u201994 had added David Furner, John Lomax, Quentin Pongia, Mullins and Ken Nagas to the nucleus of champions Mal Meninga, Brad Clyde, Ricky Stuart and Laurie Daley. And that mob did go back-to-back in \u201989 and \u201990, and made four grand finals, and the finals every year until Super League came along. But that was a dynasty. Cronulla, meanwhile, have lost players. Two of their best: fullback Ben Barba is off to France and hooker and middle-man manager Mick Ennis is off to the media. In their place are workhorse Panthers big man Jeremy Latimore and crazy-horse Bulldogs enigma Tony Williams, fine footy players for sure \u2013 but spinal cord members they are not. In 2016 the Sharks welcomed James Maloney and Chad Townsend, their six and seven. The year before it was Ennis, Barba and the super utility Jack Bird. They built better. This year, not so much. The Roosters went into 2014 with many pundits predicting \u2013 from a look at their roster, which is effectively the only data set one can hold a looking glass upon \u2013 they had the best chance of going back-to-back since those Broncos of the previous millennia. They had lost only the often-penalised meat axe Luke O\u2019Donnell and the bench forward Martin Kennedy. They added Remi Casty (from Catalans), Jackson Hastings (Dragons) and Heath L\u2019Estrange (Bradford). Contracts were signed by Anthony Minichiello, Mitchell Pearce, Daniel Tupou, Mitch Aubusson, Daniel Mortimer, Frank-Paul Nuuausala and a certain Sonny Bill Williams. And they hummed on into 2014 and finished minor premiers. They lost their qualifying final by a point to Penrith Panthers, then won their semi-final against North Queensland 31-30 after leading 30-nil before half-time. A 76th minute Maloney field goal stayed the execution that would follow next week when they faced Souths who had run third, beaten Manly and had a break. And there died Rooster dreams. In late 2015 they punted Maloney to the premiers, Sonny Bill took off and they\u2019ve been middling ever since. North Queensland Cowboys entered 2016 with, just like the Roosters before them, strongly tipped to emulate the Broncos. They had lost only the workhorse forward Glenn Hall. Yet they hadn\u2019t grown and they didn\u2019t add strength. Shaun Hudson came from Gold Coast Titans and Jahrome Hughes from Townsville Blackhawks. Hudson didn\u2019t get on the park. Hughes played one game and signed for Storm in June. Six of their players were bashed around in State of Origin, including their seemingly bash-proof champion Johnathan Thurston. They still finished fourth, a points-differential decision over their fellow grand finalists Brisbane Broncos who also had six Origin-battered players. In the first final the Cows were beaten up by Melboune Storm at AAMI Park. The next one they tipped out the Broncos 26-20 in Townsville. And in week three they limped on down to Sydney and were rissoled by the premiers. Souths\u2019 defence of their title in 2015 began by losing Sam Burgess to Bath and Ben Te\u2019o to Leinster. Souths finished seventh. And that\u2019s all they\u2019d probably like to remember about that. They did win the Auckland Nines, though. And here we are. The Sharks defending the indefensible. Or is it? They do have James Maloney still, and he\u2019s a fun running gun. Valentine Holmes always wanted to play fullback and now gets his chance. Jack Bird will improve again. And to the meat of their forward pack comes Jeremy Latimore and Tony Williams. But Paul Gallen and Luke Lewis are blown calf from limping 26 rounds. And they\u2019ll be hard marked and studied by all the other clubs. And history is against them. And they haven\u2019t built on their success. Had they hung onto Ennis and Barba, you could say they were par, another top four chance and from there who knows. But these Sharks? History tell us it\u2019s going to be difficult to go back-to-back.",

Storebrand, a sustainable investment manager with $68bn in assets, sold off $34.8m worth of shares in Phillips 66, Marathon Petroleum Corporation, and Enbridge, the company announced Wednesday. The three companies are partial owners of the pipeline. \u201cWe hope that our actions and the actions of other likeminded investors in either divesting or calling for an alternative [pipeline] route will make some sort of an impact,\u201d said Matthew Smith, the head of Storebrand\u2019s sustainability team. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe\u2019s attempt to halt or reroute the Dakota Access pipeline away from their water source became an international rallying cry for indigenous and environmental activists last year. Thousands of people traveled to encampments established near the site of the proposed river crossing in North Dakota. The camps saw frequent clashes between activists, law enforcement, and private security guards as the \u201cwater protecters\u201d engaged in civil disobedience to attempt to halt construction. In addition to the protest encampments, opponents of the pipeline have waged divestment campaigns against the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners. Using the slogan Defund DAPL, activists have also urged individuals and institutions to move money out of banks that are financing pipeline construction, including Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Victories thus far include the decisions by a Norwegian bank, DNB, and the Norwegian mutual fund Odin Fund Management to sell their shares in companies connected to the pipeline last November. The Seattle City Council voted this month not to renew the city\u2019s contract with Wells Fargo over the bank\u2019s involvement with the pipeline project, removing $3bn from the bank\u2019s coffers. Other cities are considering similar moves. On Tuesday, the indigenous activist Jackie Fielder helped lead a protest at the San Francisco board of supervisors, which she is hoping to persuade to divest from DAPL-connected banks. \u201cThe thing about the No DAPL movement is that it\u2019s everywhere,\u201d Fielder said. \u201cWe have the economic power to show companies that when they finance an environmentally racist project and hire private security and collude with law enforcement, their bottom line will suffer.\u201d Smith said Storeband had worked for months to attempt to influence the pipeline route, with no success.

When you divest from companies, you give up your possibility to influence companies to come to a better solution,\u201d Smith said. It was only after all these efforts failed to produce Storebrand\u2019s goals \u2013 prior informed consent of indigenous tribes before crossing treaty land and a full environmental impact study \u2013 that the investor decided to sell its shares. The divestment campaign is gaining steam as the hope of stopping the pipeline dwindles. On 7 February \u2013 the same day the Seattle city council voted to divest from Wells Fargo \u2013 the US Army Corps of Engineers provided notice that it would grant the final permit required for the pipeline. That decision followed an order by Donald Trump \u2013 another investor in Energy Transfer Partners \u2013 to expedite the project. Construction recommenced on 9 February.

      "bodyText": "There was a time when Theresa May cared that the public considered the Conservatives to be the \u201cnasty party\u201d. That time has long past. Now Theresa is ruler of all she surveys. She has created the world in her own image and it is good. With Labour posing little threat and surrounded only by flatterers, the prime minister has absolute power. And with that absolute power has come an absolute lack of self-criticism. She no longer notices nor cares what people think. She even imagines that saying the word \u201cInc-red-i-ble\u201d in the manner of a 1970s comedian on the sex offender register is funny. Prime minister\u2019s questions has come to this. Jeremy Corbyn had chosen to use all six of his questions on the prime minister\u2019s decision to override a court judgment to extend personal independence payments to people with mental as well as physical disabilities. It should have been a good call on the Labour leader\u2019s part, as picking on people with dementia and mental illness is not generally a good look for a government. Theresa, though, was outraged that anyone should dare question her judgment. \u201cNo one is going to see a cut in their payments,\u201d she said, wilfully missing the point that the real issue was the 120,000 people who wouldn\u2019t now be getting the money that the judiciary had said they should have. Corbyn then accused her of trying to sneak the changes in legislation through parliament without consultation. The prime minister narrowed her eyes. How dare he talk to her like that? How very dare he? Any member of her cabinet who took that tone would be out of a job. \u201cWe made a written ministerial statement to the house last Thursday,\u201d she replied, her voice pure ice. \u201cAnd the work and pensions secretary left a message on a voicemail.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound entirely sure whose.

      "body": "<p>A woman next to me on the bus the other day ate a lasagne out of a cardboard box. Slithery sheets of pasta, gloopy sauce and just a small plastic fork. It was something of a struggle for her. For me, it wasn\u2019t as bad as the smell of hot tuna on the tube or the kids who leave chicken boxes everywhere. But lasagne? Is this now considered a portable food?</p> <p>I am as bemused by it as I am by sales of boiled eggs and spinach leaves in little plastic pots. Does anyone actually think, \u201cI really want a boiled egg and some leaves \u2013 how can I possibly get one without the intense labour involved in actually boiling an egg?\u201d Obviously some do \u2013 perhaps because they have become crazed by protein. Indeed, as the range of foods we graze on expands, so do the places we think we can eat them. We can have whatever we want, wherever\u00a0we are.</p> <p>Now it is necessary to tell theatregoers that they cannot munch their way through \u2013 I don\u2019t know, a burrito? Some sushi? A bowl of couscous? \u2013 during a performance. What fresh deprivation is this? Those attending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/18/whos-afraid-of-virginia-woolf-edward-albee\" title=\"\">Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf</a> at the Harold Pinter theatre in London have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39126467\" title=\"\">been asked not to eat during the show</a> because some parts of the play \u201care extremely intense and quiet\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/feb/19/imelda-staunton-whos-afraid-virginia-woolf-interview-rachel-cooke\" title=\"\">The show\u2019s star, Imelda Staunton</a>, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/nov/22/imelda-staunton-ban-eating-in-theatres-harry-potter-vera-drake\" title=\"\">had similar issues with this phenomenon in the past</a>, saying she did not understand \u201cthis obsession with having to eat and drink something at every moment\u201d. These actor types! First they <a href=\"http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/07-2014/theatres-mobile-phones-jermyn-street_35077.html\" title=\"\">came for your phones</a>, now they are coming for your boiled sweets. You may pay \u00a3100 a ticket, but you will not slurp. I like this audacity, I like that they are saying, \u201cThis is not a public space, this is something different.\u201d</p> <p>This has to be said because our definition of what it is OK to do in public spaces has shifted. The boundaries are blurred. If you can have a\u00a0hotdog in the cinema, why can\u2019t you have a bacon bap at a play? On public transport, men nurse their stinky burgers; women pick at cold, dead salads. Salad remains a food women are permitted to eat in public \u2013 in private, we guzzle artificially sweetened yoghurt while climaxing over some reduced-fat cream cheese, of course.</p> <p>Eating in public, however, is fraught. Some consider it a low-rent and unspeakably vulgar thing to do. Women are shamed for it. There have been Facebook groups set up for the shaming of women eating on the tube. Eating is a reminder of other appetites, and showing any appetite in public is not \u201cclassy\u201d or \u201cfeminine\u201d. When I was a girl, I was told never to be seen eating in my school uniform. \u201cI\u2019ll just take it off then, Miss.\u201d The likes of Kate Middleton can never be seen to eat in public while her husband can chomp away. There is something both out of control and intimate about being seen eating, something that we all recognise. Middleton may simply not want to be photographed from an unflattering angle \u2013 we remember <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Miliband_bacon_sandwich_photograph\" title=\"\">what happened to Ed Miliband</a> \u2013 but many women have all sorts of anxieties about consuming food in public. Too much. Too little.</p> <p>Still a lot of women feel uneasy about eating alone in a restaurant. They would rather shovel food into their mouths where no one can see, where there is no accusatory gaze. Sometimes we would rather not be aware of what we are doing. But the culture of constant grazing is the opposite of the sense of food as a social experience. It is intensely antisocial. Everyone is caught up in this snack-based\u00a0ennui.</p> <p>This food culture runs counter to the vast circulation of images of and knowledge about food. The public space that matters is not actual but visual, the one overrun by Instagrammed beauty. The phone has become the sixth sense. How it looks matters more than how it feels. Construct a selfie with the menu: while seated, cover your face with an open menu; we should only see your eyes. Here you are in a restaurant \u2013 you, your plate, your friends sharing your joy; this is how you want to appear eating in public.</p> <p>But this is not most people\u2019s experience of eating at all, is it? There is a lot of this solitary grazing. There is a lot of eating that does not involve sitting at a table with a knife and fork. Every slimming club in the world will tell you the same as a posh health spa or indeed a monastery: don\u2019t do anything else as you eat. Don\u2019t watch TV or be online. Be there with your food. Be present. Be mindful. Be thankful. Be conscious with your cucumber. It\u2019s a beautiful fantasy.</p> <p>Because Staunton\u2019s small request reveals another reality: that, actually, people do now think that leisure means having to eat and drink something at every moment. I certainly do. The idea that hours go by where something else is more important than stuffing our mouths, or requires our full attention, is ... well, strange. A\u00a0violation of our basic right to a\u00a0halloumi wrap whenever we\u00a0want it.</p>",

Is this now considered a portable food? I am as bemused by it as I am by sales of boiled eggs and spinach leaves in little plastic pots. Does anyone actually think, \u201cI really want a boiled egg and some leaves \u2013 how can I possibly get one without the intense labour involved in actually boiling an egg?\u201d Obviously some do \u2013 perhaps because they have become crazed by protein. Indeed, as the range of foods we graze on expands, so do the places we think we can eat them. We can have whatever we want, wherever&nbsp;we are. Now it is necessary to tell theatregoers that they cannot munch their way through \u2013 I don\u2019t know, a burrito? Some sushi? A bowl of couscous? \u2013 during a performance. What fresh deprivation is this? Those attending Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf at the Harold Pinter theatre in London have been asked not to eat during the show because some parts of the play \u201care extremely intense and quiet\u201d. The show\u2019s star, Imelda Staunton, has had similar issues with this phenomenon in the past, saying she did not understand \u201cthis obsession with having to eat and drink something at every moment\u201d. These actor types! First they came for your phones, now they are coming for your boiled sweets. You may pay \u00a3100 a ticket, but you will not slurp. I like this audacity, I like that they are saying, \u201cThis is not a public space, this is something different.\u201d This has to be said because our definition of what it is OK to do in public spaces has shifted. The boundaries are blurred. If you can have a&nbsp;hotdog in the cinema, why can\u2019t you have a bacon bap at a play? On public transport, men nurse their stinky burgers; women pick at cold, dead salads. Salad remains a food women are permitted to eat in public \u2013 in private, we guzzle artificially sweetened yoghurt while climaxing over some reduced-fat cream cheese, of course. Eating in public, however, is fraught. Some consider it a low-rent and unspeakably vulgar thing to do. Women are shamed for it. There have been Facebook groups set up for the shaming of women eating on the tube. Eating is a reminder of other appetites, and showing any appetite in public is not \u201cclassy\u201d or \u201cfeminine\u201d. When I was a girl, I was told never to be seen eating in my school uniform. \u201cI\u2019ll just take it off then, Miss.\u201d The likes of Kate Middleton can never be seen to eat in public while her husband can chomp away. There is something both out of control and intimate about being seen eating, something that we all recognise. Middleton may simply not want to be photographed from an unflattering angle \u2013 we remember what happened to Ed Miliband \u2013 but many women have all sorts of anxieties about consuming food in public. Too much. Too little. Still a lot of women feel uneasy about eating alone in a restaurant. They would rather shovel food into their mouths where no one can see, where there is no accusatory gaze. Sometimes we would rather not be aware of what we are doing. But the culture of constant grazing is the opposite of the sense of food as a social experience. It is intensely antisocial. Everyone is caught up in this snack-based&nbsp;ennui. This food culture runs counter to the vast circulation of images of and knowledge about food. The public space that matters is not actual but visual, the one overrun by Instagrammed beauty. The phone has become the sixth sense. How it looks matters more than how it feels. Construct a selfie with the menu: while seated, cover your face with an open menu; we should only see your eyes. Here you are in a restaurant \u2013 you, your plate, your friends sharing your joy; this is how you want to appear eating in public. But this is not most people\u2019s experience of eating at all, is it? There is a lot of this solitary grazing. There is a lot of eating that does not involve sitting at a table with a knife and fork. Every slimming club in the world will tell you the same as a posh health spa or indeed a monastery: don\u2019t do anything else as you eat. Don\u2019t watch TV or be online. Be there with your food. Be present. Be mindful. Be thankful. Be conscious with your cucumber. It\u2019s a beautiful fantasy. Because Staunton\u2019s small request reveals another reality: that, actually, people do now think that leisure means having to eat and drink something at every moment. I certainly do. The idea that hours go by where something else is more important than stuffing our mouths, or requires our full attention, is ... well, strange. A&nbsp;violation of our basic right to a&nbsp;halloumi wrap whenever we&nbsp;want it.",

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel is facing calls to ban the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, from entering Germany while a German journalist continues to be held in an Istanbul prison. Erdo\u011fan, who campaigned in Germany in 2011 and 2014, was rumoured to be planning a political rally to secure the symbolically important diaspora vote before April\u2019s referendum in Turkey on giving him greater powers. But Merkel\u2019s government is under increasing pressure from German coalition and opposition parties to stand up to the Turkish president after the Turkey correspondent of Die Welt newspaper, Deniz Y\u00fccel, last month became the first German citizen to be arrested as part of Erdogan\u2019s crackdown on the press. Ralf J\u00e4ger, the interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia and a member of the Social Democratic party that forms a coalition with Merkel\u2019s CDU, called on the government to \u201censure that such rallies take place neither in North Rhine-Westphalia or elsewhere in Germany\u201d.

Sevim Da\u011fdelen, a Left party MP with Kurdish origins, said Merkel had \u201ca political duty and the legal means to stop the Turkish head of state from campaigning on German soil for the abolition of democracy and the introduction of the death penalty\u201d. Austria has already told Erdo\u011fan he is not welcome to campaign for votes amongst the Turkish diaspora in the country, with the foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, saying in a statement that \u201cwe clearly reject bringing the Turkish campaign and polarisation to Austria\u201d. But on Wednesday Merkel\u2019s spokesman said a ban would send the wrong signal. Steffen Seibert said: \u201cThe German government deplores the fact that freedom of speech and freedom of the press are currently limited in Turkey to an unacceptable degree. \u201cIf we deplore this in another country, then we should be even more alert to make sure that freedom of speech is respected, within the framework of the law, in our own country. We should demonstrate what we demand from others.\u201d Niels Annen, the Social Democrats\u2019 foreign policy spokesman, praised the government\u2019s decision to rule out a ban but said the current diplomatic crisis was a result of the German chancellor letting the refugee swap deal between Turkey and the EU influence her dealings with Erdo\u011fan. \u201cMerkel is no longer a believable advocate for democracy and the rule of law in Turkey,\u201d he said. In the referendum on 18 April, the Turkish public will vote on proposed changes that would boost the powers of the president, allowing Erdo\u011fan to scrap the post of prime minister, control budgets, appoint more judges and stay in office for two more terms. The support of the Turkish diaspora in Germany, a community of about 1.4 million people, holds an important symbolic significance to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AK party. \u201cPictures of German stadiums filled with pro-Erdo\u011fan supporters allow the AKP to project itself back to Turkey as the one party that protects Turks around the world,\u201d said Alexander Clarkson, a researcher on the interaction between German politics and migrant communities at King\u2019s College London.

Thought to be the biggest advance for a musician\u2019s memoir, Born to Run was a lucrative deal for Simon &amp; Schuster, with Springsteen revealing himself to be a candid autobiographer, writing freely about his difficult relationship with his father and his battle with depression.

Her son Mark took it upon himself to help secure a deal, predicting that he would get \u00a38-20m. Rupert Murdoch, who wanted his ideological ally to publish with his company HarperCollins, poured cold water on the ambition: \u201cGood luck to him if he can but I don\u2019t think he will,\u201d he crowed.

Thought to be the biggest advance for a musician\u2019s memoir, Born to Run was a lucrative deal for Simon &amp; Schuster, with Springsteen revealing himself to be a candid autobiographer, writing freely about his difficult relationship with his father and his battle with depression. Yes, there were lines like: \u201cMy depression was spewing like an oil spill over the beautiful turquoise green gulf of my carefully planned existence.\u201d But he is the Boss. 7. The Downing Street Years and The Path to Power by Margaret Thatcher, \u00a33.5m for two books (\u00a39.2m today or $11.3m) When: 1993 and 1995 Why? Rupert Murdoch was reportedly on Thatcher\u2019s back before she left office, encouraging the Iron Lady to write a memoir. Her son Mark took it upon himself to help secure a deal, predicting that he would get \u00a38-20m. Rupert Murdoch, who wanted his ideological ally to publish with his company HarperCollins, poured cold water on the ambition: \u201cGood luck to him if he can but I don\u2019t think he will,\u201d he crowed. As predicted, Thatcher sold the books to HarperCollins for much less. 8. The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo by Amy Schumer ($9m) When? 2015 Why? It might be a bigger figure than one would expect, but as many may have anticipated, it did start with a chapter called An Open Letter to My Vagina. Critics praised the comedian\u2019s collection of essays for the moments less focused on delivering zingers, where she left room for serious topics like her father\u2019s multiple sclerosis diagnosis, her thoughts on gun control and sexual consent. It made the New York Times bestseller list, but it isn\u2019t clear if Simon &amp; Schuster made its money back. 9. The Casual Vacancy by JK Rowling (somewhere between \u00a32m and $8 million) When? 2012 Why? Both figures have been quoted extensively, but one thing is sure: gone are the days of Rowling getting \u00a32,000 to write a Harry Potter book (her laughable advance for the first two). Being her first post-Harry novel and scandalously aimed at adults rather than children, it was a mixed success with critics. \u201cIt has the C-word in it!\u201d bleated countless tabloids. As if Little, Brown cared \u2013 was there ever a risk of it not making its money back? 10. Life by Keith Richards ($7.3m, $8.8m today) When? 2010 Why? Name your reason. Vicarious thrills? Its casual catalogue of everything a human being can snort or stab into their bodies? The details about Mick Jagger\u2019s \u201ctiny todger\u201d? Somewhat unexpectedly, Life \u2013 which was written \u201cwith\u201d journalist James Fox \u2013 was resoundingly praised for its literary quality. It sold more than 1m copies.",

Around a third of children in London \u2013 where there has been a 2% increase in applications \u2013 have missed out on their first choice of secondary school, while local authorities in larger cities have also had to deliver bad news to disappointed parents. As around half a million families found out on Wednesday which secondary school their children will attend on what is known as national offers day, councils are reporting a further squeeze on secondary school places caused by an increase in applications. Early figures suggest that disappointment among children and their families are most severe in larger cities, particularly London \u2013 with education experts warning that a rising birth rate will continue to put pressure on secondary school places and result in more disappointed pupils. While in some areas of the country, including Somerset, Durham, North Lincolnshire, Rochdale and Cornwall, virtually every child has got into their preferred school, in others it was a different story.

Writing for a five- or 10-minute sketch is different than writing a book, which has to be a narrative.\u201d His previous works include the books True Believers and Heyday. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that Kurt will do most of the writing,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cWe have that arrangement whereby he doesn\u2019t put on the wig, I don\u2019t open up a Word document.\u201d The star of films including Beetlejuice and Glengarry Glen Ross, isn\u2019t entirely fresh to the literary scene, however. In 2008 he released a book A Promise to Ourselves: A Journey Through Fatherhood and Divorce, and last year he wrote his memoir Nevertheless. After casting Baldwin as Trump, Saturday Night Live has been experiencing record ratings and memorably aroused the ire of the president himself. Trump has tweeted that Baldwin\u2019s impression \u201ccan\u2019t get any worse\u201d. It\u2019s expected that he will return to make an appearance on this Saturday\u2019s episode, hosted by Octavia Spencer.",

      "body": "<p>Modern art centenaries are piling up. There are (at least) three big ones this year: the Russian revolution with <a href=\"http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/future-exhibitions/imagine-moscow\">its impact on the avant garde</a>, Marcel Duchamp\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)#/media/File%3ADuchamp_Fountaine.jpg\">Fountain</a>, and the Dutch art and design movement De Stijl, founded by Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg in 1917.</p> <p>De Stijl is the most colourful \u2013 if you like red, yellow and blue. The celebrations in the Netherlands include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/03/dutch-celebrate-mondrian-cladding-the-hague-city-hall\">a giant Mondrian on The Hague\u2019s town hall</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.stedelijk.nl/en/exhibitions/de-stijl-at-the-stedelijk\">Stedelijk Museum</a> in Amsterdam exploring De Stijl\u2019s influence on contemporary artists such as Isa Genzken and The Hague\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gemeentemuseum.nl/en/home\">Gemeentemuseum</a> showing all 300 of its Mondrians in <a href=\"https://www.gemeentemuseum.nl/en/mondrian-dutch-design-100-years-de-stijl\">a colossal retrospective</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPiet Mondrian is perhaps the greatest modern artist who ever lived\u201d, boasts the latter\u2019s website. Thanks for putting in that \u201cperhaps\u201d. Yet the other night I was shocked by my own reaction to some of Mondrian\u2019s works, on view at London\u2019s Tate Modern. There is no other word for what I felt except boredom. What a thing to feel, in front of \u201cthe greatest modern artist who ever lived\u201d! </p> <p>Admittedly, the way Tate Modern currently displays its De Stijl paintings is not helpful \u2013 they are in a gallery called <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern/display/artist-and-society/view-sao-paulo-abstraction-and-society\">A View from Sao Paulo: Art and Society</a>, which takes its cue from Latin American abstract art to shoehorn in abstractions that it claims have a social conscience hidden in intersecting lines and planes of flat colour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1862e7f43600718aa5479b9ee3225d5246a3d07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1862e7f43600718aa5479b9ee3225d5246a3d07/0_0_4038_4200/961.jpg\" alt=\"Square dance...

Yet when you look at an abstract painting, this sort of information is fundamentally irrelevant. Abstract art is art beyond words. It is visually compelling, or it is nothing.</p> <p>What struck me suddenly was how small and square Mondrian\u2019s paintings are.

      "bodyText": "Modern art centenaries are piling up. There are (at least) three big ones this year: the Russian revolution with its impact on the avant garde, Marcel Duchamp\u2019s Fountain, and the Dutch art and design movement De Stijl, founded by Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg in 1917. De Stijl is the most colourful \u2013 if you like red, yellow and blue. The celebrations in the Netherlands include a giant Mondrian on The Hague\u2019s town hall, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam exploring De Stijl\u2019s influence on contemporary artists such as Isa Genzken and The Hague\u2019s Gemeentemuseum showing all 300 of its Mondrians in a colossal retrospective. \u201cPiet Mondrian is perhaps the greatest modern artist who ever lived\u201d, boasts the latter\u2019s website. Thanks for putting in that \u201cperhaps\u201d. Yet the other night I was shocked by my own reaction to some of Mondrian\u2019s works, on view at London\u2019s Tate Modern. There is no other word for what I felt except boredom. What a thing to feel, in front of \u201cthe greatest modern artist who ever lived\u201d! Admittedly, the way Tate Modern currently displays its De Stijl paintings is not helpful \u2013 they are in a gallery called A View from Sao Paulo: Art and Society, which takes its cue from Latin American abstract art to shoehorn in abstractions that it claims have a social conscience hidden in intersecting lines and planes of flat colour. Technically this is true of De Stijl, who believed their spiritual geometries could save the world, and wanted to remake reality as a platonic ideal, not only through paintings but in the radical architecture and furniture that is perhaps its most popular legacy. Yet when you look at an abstract painting, this sort of information is fundamentally irrelevant. Abstract art is art beyond words. It is visually compelling, or it is nothing. What struck me suddenly was how small and square Mondrian\u2019s paintings are. They are intellectual constructs that don\u2019t give your soul much room to move around in. Which brings me to my second confession. European abstract art of the early 20th century is, to my eyes, dead stuff that belongs in textbooks. It is terribly \u201cimportant\u201d. Yet it completely lacks the excitement and humanity of the truly great abstract art of the later 20th century: American abstract expressionism. It is a measure of how much cultural prejudice there still is against the vulgar upstarts of the new world and how snobbishly we revere European art that it is still widely assumed that Mondrian, Kandinsky and other early 20th century abstract artists are somehow more serious, genuine and pure than Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock and Barnett Newman. Perhaps it is indeed the slight dullness of those old European abstract painters \u2013 the way we have to steel ourselves to study them \u2013 that persuades us they are more worthy than the brash Americans, who in reality took abstract painting to much greater artistic heights and deeper psychic lows. If you don\u2019t believe me, go to Tate Modern, look at its Mondrians, then go to the room where Rothko\u2019s Seagram Murals are hung. It is like looking at a pond before diving into the sea. Rothko\u2019s mighty, molten expanses of agonised colour suck you in, half-drown you, and leave you gasping. Mondrian is more like a maths teacher talking in a monotone.

      "body": "<p>On a freezing, rainswept Sunday in a conference room in Birmingham Central mosque, a young woman in a black padded jacket is crying quietly. Her name is Zaynab and as she lifts up her glasses to rub at her eyes, one of the three religious scholars sitting opposite her starts to speak.</p> <p>\u201cThe panel is in agreement, this marriage is to be dissolved today, Zaynab,\u201d says Dr Amra Bone, one of the only female sharia council judges in the country. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the ingredients of an Islamic marriage; there is no love, trust, compassion or respect. You have an <em>iddah</em> [waiting] period of three menstrual cycles and you are then free to marry again.\u201d</p> <p>As Zaynab collects her paperwork, Bone\u2019s colleague, Shaykh Talha Bukhari, an elderly man with a white beard, turns to me. \u201cMarriage is not for shedding tears,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cbut here they are rolling down.\u201d</p> <p>I am at the mosque\u2019s sharia council, which in the past year has dealt with 400 requests for divorce. Sharia councils \u2013 often mislabelled as sharia courts \u2013 have a sinister reputation in the UK. Like halal meat and the niqab, they are a dog whistle for those seeking to imply that there is a creeping Islamification of the UK. In part, this is because sharia \u2013 Islamic \u2013 law is synonymous in many people\u2019s minds with terrifying punishments such as stoning. The reality of the councils is much less bloodthirsty but there are still reasons to worry.</p> <p>Almost all the sharia councils, which first appeared in the UK in the 1980s, were founded to facilitate Islamic divorces for Muslim women who need a religious scholar to end their marriage where their husbands don\u2019t consent (they may also offer religious advice on inheritance, wills or issue religious rulings). They are not the only religious councils \u2013 there are also the Jewish Orthodox Beth Din, and Catholic tribunals. The sharia councils are often accused of operating a \u201cparallel legal system\u201d in the UK, but their rulings have no legal standing here or abroad, and they have no enforcement powers. As unofficial bodies, they also have no jurisdiction over custody or financial issues. What they rely on is the weight that religious rulings carry in the Muslim community.</p> <p>Surprisingly little is known about the councils \u2013 even down to how many there are in the UK (estimates range <a href=\"https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/law/An_exploratory_study_of_Shariah_councils_in_England_with_respect_to_family_law_.pdf\">from 30</a> to 80). Some, like Birmingham\u2019s, are large and long established; others are informal, backroom affairs. Individual imams also carry out the same functions, complicating their definition. Samia Bano, a senior lecturer in law at Soas University of London who has written <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Muslim-Women-Shariah-Councils-Transcending/dp/0230221483/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1488211725&amp;sr=1-1\">a book on sharia councils</a>, jokes that they are so informal \u201cI could open one tomorrow\u201d. Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/26/legal-aid-cuts-put-strain-on-divorcees\">cuts to legal aid made civil divorces more expensive,</a> more couples than ever are turning to them. Yet their critics say they pose a serious threat to Muslim women in the UK.</p> <p>Prompted by fears that they were discriminatory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/26/theresa-may-launches-sharia-law-review\">Theresa May launched a government inquiry in May last year</a>. Just a month later, the Home Affairs Committee announced its own. In December, the Casey Review by Dame Louise Casey into integration included claims that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-casey-review-a-review-into-opportunity-and-integration\">sharia councils \u201csupported the values of extremists, condoned wife-beating, ignored marital rape and allowed forced marriages\u201d</a>. And in January, a bill aimed at sharia councils put forward by the independent peer Baroness Cox (to bring equality legislation to bear on arbitration and mediation services) had its second reading in the House of Lords, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jun/08/sharia-bill-lords-muslim-women\">six years after she first began lobbying for one</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9536b21ac9d1274e6416be82ffa89741ec1b41f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9536b21ac9d1274e6416be82ffa89741ec1b41f1/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Birmingham Central Mosque.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Birmingham Central mosque.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Women\u2019s groups, meanwhile, have been raising the alarm for some years. Southall Black Sisters, which addresses the needs of BAME women, calls the councils patriarchal and regressive and wants them shut down. Women are being pressured to return to abusive husbands, it says, and they interfere with child custody and financial matters. Muslim women\u2019s groups accuse Sharia councils of ignoring women\u2019s rights under Islamic, as well as civil, law and cite hair-raising cases of women being told to endure marital rape and polygamy. The Muslim Women\u2019s Network points to an instance where a woman was being repeatedly raped by her husband, who had also married again, but was told to be \u201cpatient\u201d by a mediator from a sharia council. They say the councils should be reformed, until an alternative way of seeking a religious divorce can be found.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, given their negative press, sharia councils are wary of media interest. Birmingham is confident enough about its reputation to be an exception.</p> <p>Saba Butt is the council\u2019s administrator. In the months before today\u2019s panel meeting, she has collected testimony and paperwork from the spouses involved in each case, starting with the wives. The women are asked if they want to go through a reconciliation process, or straight to the panel for a decision (the councils offer couples mediation). Islamic marriages are contracts (<em>nikahs</em>), signed by both parties and two witnesses. Each must contain an amount of money (<em>mahr</em>) that is granted to the wife. While both men and women can obtain a divorce in Islam, the process is simpler for men (unless the woman has included an equal right to divorce in the contract, and few do).</p> <p>Subject to various conditions and restrictions, husbands can end the marriage simply by declaring they are divorcing their wife \u2013 known as a <em>talaq</em>. A wife can also initiate a divorce (known as a <em>khula</em>), and if the husband agrees, the marriage can be ended. If he contests it, a third party can dissolve the contract \u2013 which is where sharia councils step in. Without the council rulings, the panel tell me, many women feel they are still married in the sight of God \u2013 even if they have had a civil divorce.</p> <p>During the afternoon, I watch women file in, one by one, as seven cases are heard. Some are alone, others have relatives with them; some are mothers. There is a teaching assistant and an eye specialist among them, and most hearings are in English (two women prefer to speak in Urdu). All but one have their marriages dissolved.</p> <p>Zaynab is a young mother. She explains that her marriage fell apart in 2014, and the last time she saw her husband was when he tried to drunkenly break into her home. He has since moved away.</p> <p>The three scholars question her gently. Is her marriage registered under English law? No, her husband was worried it would affect his benefits. Did he support her and their children financially? Never. Did he have problems with addiction and gambling? Yes. They shake their heads.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f051859dd81613b066fe24a22a8a6f25de559d3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f051859dd81613b066fe24a22a8a6f25de559d3d/0_217_5265_3159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Muslim wedding.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Muslim wedding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photofusion/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bone says that the panel all work as volunteers and feel it is their Islamic duty to help the community resolve conflicts. Bukhari recites a story of how the prophet Muhammad ended a woman\u2019s marriage because \u201cshe did not like being with her husband\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA marriage is not for suffering or for sacrifice,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Yet because each council operates alone, with rulings based on its panel\u2019s personal knowledge and interpretation of religious laws, their approach and decisions can vary wildly. Bano says some of the 25 women she interviewed for her book found sharia councils patriarchal and problematic. Often women got round this by \u201cforum shopping\u201d for a council that suited them. Yet when things go wrong, there is no accountability.</p> <p>Amara, a 45-year-old lawyer from London, went to see a sharia council in her 20s. During her three-year marriage, she says her husband hit her, tried to push her down the stairs when she was pregnant, and kept her prisoner for three days. She took out an injunction against him, began civil divorce proceedings, and finally approached a sharia council.</p> <p>Her voice shakes as she remembers how the three panel judges \u2013 all elderly men \u2013 reacted. \u201cThey asked things like: \u2018What did you do to provoke him?\u2019\u201d Her husband had been restricted by the court to supervised contact with their children because of his violence, yet the judges insisted on talking about access. \u201cAll they cared about was his relationship with the children \u2013 not their safety, or my safety.\u201d</p> <p>Amara dropped the case, but later approached the Muslim College in Ealing. This, she says, \u201cwas a completely different experience\u201d. Her case was dealt with in writing, professionally, and resolved within a few months.</p> <p>One pressing problem is the increasing number of Muslim couples who are at the mercy of sharia councils because they have had religious ceremonies to mark their marriage but are not legally married under UK law. There is no central registry of Islamic marriages (marriages do not have to take place in a mosque, and you do not need an imam), so it is impossible to know how many couples have had only religious services \u2013 Aina Khan, a lawyer and campaigner, has estimated that there could be <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article4486748.ece\">100,000 couples in Britain</a> (under the current Marriage Act, only Anglicans, Quakers and Jews are obliged to register their marriage).</p> <p>\u201cIn the past five years there has been a steep increase [in couples having only religious marriages]. It used to be about half [of my clients], now it has crept up to 80%,\u201d says Khan. Some couples intend to have a civil service at a later date, others do not realise an Islamic marriage undertaken in the UK is not legally recognised; some feel it is only a religious marriage that is important to them.</p> <p>Khan says she has also seen an increase in men wanting to avoid losing money or property in a divorce. \u201cInstead of a prenuptial agreement, men are refusing a legal marriage. Women are worried about losing their <em>rishta</em> [marriage proposal] so they say: \u2018OK\u2019.\u201d Yet this means these Muslim women do not have legal protection, even if they have given up work to look after children. Women risk being turned out of their homes with nothing if their marriages break down \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/575973/The_Casey_Review_Report.pdf\">the Casey Review</a> explains that this can be particularly worrying with the \u201clower levels of female employment, lower levels of English language and, anecdotally at least, a lack of awareness of other civil rights\u201d in Muslim communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"620dbbdbaa4666b66b8c496f877223d267c2a5a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/620dbbdbaa4666b66b8c496f877223d267c2a5a0/0_205_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cReligion inherently discriminates against women\u201d \u2026 Pragna Patel, chair of Southall Black Sisters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cReligion inherently discriminates against women\u201d \u2026 Pragna Patel, chair of Southall Black Sisters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Southall Black Sisters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Muslim women who have civil marriages will need a civil divorce too. But those with no civil marriage have to turn to sharia councils and risk being left in limbo for years. Khan says one of her clients had started a new relationship and was pregnant with a child with still no sign of her Islamic divorce from the sharia council she applied to.</p> <p>Khan fears councils are becoming increasingly misogynistic and inefficient. \u201cSadly they have become a victim of their own success \u2013 they are overworked. The Salafi [ultra-conservative] influence on religion has brought in a real misogyny. They have become more hardline and anti-female.\u201d</p> <p>This can be seen in the most frightening complaint against sharia councils \u2013 that with divorce permissible but discouraged by Islam, women are pressured into mediation with violent partners \u2013 or even reconciliation. Savin Bapir-Tarvey, a psychologist with the Iranian and Kurdish Women\u2019s Rights Organisation (IKWRO), sees around 15 clients a week, many of whom are extremely vulnerable. She says cultural concepts such as honour are used to manipulate women. \u201cThey have experienced severe abuse and their children have witnessed it,\u201d she says, but they are told that \u201cto leave would bring shame on the family\u201d.</p> <p>Even marital rape can be ignored. \u201cWomen who have been through FGM might not make that clear [to their new husbands], but they might say they don\u2019t want to have sex. One woman was told it was her duty \u2013 and she should pray while her husband has sex with her \u2013 basically while he raped her.\u201d</p> <p>Bone is clear on the subject of domestic violence: \u201cThe Islamic fundamental of marriage is that a woman should feel safe.\u201d If there was violence, \u201cwe would go straight ahead and dissolve it\u201d. She also disputes another criticism \u2013 that a woman\u2019s testimony at a sharia council is given half the weight of a man\u2019s, insisting that this is not true in her council and is a misinterpretation of sharia law in general.</p> <p>Over at the well known Islamic Cultural Centre and London Central mosque in Regent\u2019s Park, director Ahmad al-Dubayan is trying to reform councils from within. It has set up a board of sharia councils \u2013 18 so far \u2013 with a code of conduct. Dubayan tells me he would like to see less expensive, fairer charges for Islamic divorces (some women pay \u00a3400, men considerably less) and an end to delays. He says many Muslims do not understand their marriage rights under Islamic law and that they are putting together a manual to rectify this. There are certainly good experiences amid the horror stories. Khatija from the East Midlands tells me that when she was pregnant with her second child in 2003, she began civil divorce proceedings for coercive control, but her husband defended it. \u201cAt that point, coercive control was not a separate offence [in English law]. The judge was appalling. He told me I didn\u2019t seem to have enough reason for a divorce.\u201d Khatija was told to wait until the pair had been separated for five years \u2013 which took until 2009.</p> <p>It was the sharia council in Dewsbury, she says, who took the abuse seriously, arranging an Islamic divorce in a matter of months. \u201cThe imam I dealt with was very, very kind. I explained how I wasn\u2019t allowed out of the house, even when I was with my parents in the UK [her husband lived abroad] \u2013 he would still control me. Before I went out, I would have to ring to check with him.\u201d</p> <p>Southall Black Sisters, however, is firm in its opposition. Religion and family law are too dangerous a mix to allow sharia councils to continue to operate. \u201cReligion inherently discriminates against women,\u201d stresses director Pragna Patel. \u201cYou cannot access justice if the people who are violating your rights are dispensing it.\u201d</p> <p>Along with other secular women\u2019s groups, it has boycotted the government inquiry, pointing out that it is headed by a theologian rather than a judge, and has Islamic scholars in place of human rights experts. Sharia council supporters point out that women choose to have Islamic divorces of their own free will yet Patel says this ignores the fact that they do so to avoid being \u201ctreated as outcasts\u201d by conservative communities, who view divorce as shameful.</p> <p>Bano agrees that state law, however imperfect, \u201cis the only system that Muslim and vulnerable women have for protection\u201d and \u201cin family law matters or in issues of vulnerability and marginalisation we should never have a delegation into the community\u201d.</p> <p>IKWRO is considering another way to take on sharia councils. They are looking for a test case to prove that \u201cmarital captivity\u201d \u2013 refusing to give a woman a religious divorce \u2013 is a form of forced marriage. If men were fearful of being prosecuted under this legislation, the group says, there would be no need for sharia councils.</p> <p>Yet Muslim women\u2019s groups argue that women who feel they need a religious divorce should not be left without an avenue to obtain one, while Khan says changing the Marriage Act to ensure all marriages are registered would help protect women.

      "bodyText": "On a freezing, rainswept Sunday in a conference room in Birmingham Central mosque, a young woman in a black padded jacket is crying quietly. Her name is Zaynab and as she lifts up her glasses to rub at her eyes, one of the three religious scholars sitting opposite her starts to speak. \u201cThe panel is in agreement, this marriage is to be dissolved today, Zaynab,\u201d says Dr Amra Bone, one of the only female sharia council judges in the country. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the ingredients of an Islamic marriage; there is no love, trust, compassion or respect. You have an iddah [waiting] period of three menstrual cycles and you are then free to marry again.\u201d As Zaynab collects her paperwork, Bone\u2019s colleague, Shaykh Talha Bukhari, an elderly man with a white beard, turns to me. \u201cMarriage is not for shedding tears,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cbut here they are rolling down.\u201d I am at the mosque\u2019s sharia council, which in the past year has dealt with 400 requests for divorce. Sharia councils \u2013 often mislabelled as sharia courts \u2013 have a sinister reputation in the UK. Like halal meat and the niqab, they are a dog whistle for those seeking to imply that there is a creeping Islamification of the UK. In part, this is because sharia \u2013 Islamic \u2013 law is synonymous in many people\u2019s minds with terrifying punishments such as stoning. The reality of the councils is much less bloodthirsty but there are still reasons to worry. Almost all the sharia councils, which first appeared in the UK in the 1980s, were founded to facilitate Islamic divorces for Muslim women who need a religious scholar to end their marriage where their husbands don\u2019t consent (they may also offer religious advice on inheritance, wills or issue religious rulings). They are not the only religious councils \u2013 there are also the Jewish Orthodox Beth Din, and Catholic tribunals. The sharia councils are often accused of operating a \u201cparallel legal system\u201d in the UK, but their rulings have no legal standing here or abroad, and they have no enforcement powers. As unofficial bodies, they also have no jurisdiction over custody or financial issues. What they rely on is the weight that religious rulings carry in the Muslim community. Surprisingly little is known about the councils \u2013 even down to how many there are in the UK (estimates range from 30 to 80). Some, like Birmingham\u2019s, are large and long established; others are informal, backroom affairs. Individual imams also carry out the same functions, complicating their definition. Samia Bano, a senior lecturer in law at Soas University of London who has written a book on sharia councils, jokes that they are so informal \u201cI could open one tomorrow\u201d. Since cuts to legal aid made civil divorces more expensive, more couples than ever are turning to them. Yet their critics say they pose a serious threat to Muslim women in the UK. Prompted by fears that they were discriminatory, Theresa May launched a government inquiry in May last year. Just a month later, the Home Affairs Committee announced its own. In December, the Casey Review by Dame Louise Casey into integration included claims that sharia councils \u201csupported the values of extremists, condoned wife-beating, ignored marital rape and allowed forced marriages\u201d. And in January, a bill aimed at sharia councils put forward by the independent peer Baroness Cox (to bring equality legislation to bear on arbitration and mediation services) had its second reading in the House of Lords, six years after she first began lobbying for one. Women\u2019s groups, meanwhile, have been raising the alarm for some years. Southall Black Sisters, which addresses the needs of BAME women, calls the councils patriarchal and regressive and wants them shut down. Women are being pressured to return to abusive husbands, it says, and they interfere with child custody and financial matters. Muslim women\u2019s groups accuse Sharia councils of ignoring women\u2019s rights under Islamic, as well as civil, law and cite hair-raising cases of women being told to endure marital rape and polygamy. The Muslim Women\u2019s Network points to an instance where a woman was being repeatedly raped by her husband, who had also married again, but was told to be \u201cpatient\u201d by a mediator from a sharia council. They say the councils should be reformed, until an alternative way of seeking a religious divorce can be found. Unsurprisingly, given their negative press, sharia councils are wary of media interest. Birmingham is confident enough about its reputation to be an exception. Saba Butt is the council\u2019s administrator. In the months before today\u2019s panel meeting, she has collected testimony and paperwork from the spouses involved in each case, starting with the wives. The women are asked if they want to go through a reconciliation process, or straight to the panel for a decision (the councils offer couples mediation). Islamic marriages are contracts (nikahs), signed by both parties and two witnesses. Each must contain an amount of money (mahr) that is granted to the wife. While both men and women can obtain a divorce in Islam, the process is simpler for men (unless the woman has included an equal right to divorce in the contract, and few do). Subject to various conditions and restrictions, husbands can end the marriage simply by declaring they are divorcing their wife \u2013 known as a talaq. A wife can also initiate a divorce (known as a khula), and if the husband agrees, the marriage can be ended. If he contests it, a third party can dissolve the contract \u2013 which is where sharia councils step in. Without the council rulings, the panel tell me, many women feel they are still married in the sight of God \u2013 even if they have had a civil divorce. During the afternoon, I watch women file in, one by one, as seven cases are heard. Some are alone, others have relatives with them; some are mothers. There is a teaching assistant and an eye specialist among them, and most hearings are in English (two women prefer to speak in Urdu). All but one have their marriages dissolved. Zaynab is a young mother. She explains that her marriage fell apart in 2014, and the last time she saw her husband was when he tried to drunkenly break into her home. He has since moved away. The three scholars question her gently. Is her marriage registered under English law? No, her husband was worried it would affect his benefits. Did he support her and their children financially? Never. Did he have problems with addiction and gambling? Yes. They shake their heads. Bone says that the panel all work as volunteers and feel it is their Islamic duty to help the community resolve conflicts. Bukhari recites a story of how the prophet Muhammad ended a woman\u2019s marriage because \u201cshe did not like being with her husband\u201d. \u201cA marriage is not for suffering or for sacrifice,\u201d he says. Yet because each council operates alone, with rulings based on its panel\u2019s personal knowledge and interpretation of religious laws, their approach and decisions can vary wildly. Bano says some of the 25 women she interviewed for her book found sharia councils patriarchal and problematic. Often women got round this by \u201cforum shopping\u201d for a council that suited them. Yet when things go wrong, there is no accountability. Amara, a 45-year-old lawyer from London, went to see a sharia council in her 20s. During her three-year marriage, she says her husband hit her, tried to push her down the stairs when she was pregnant, and kept her prisoner for three days. She took out an injunction against him, began civil divorce proceedings, and finally approached a sharia council. Her voice shakes as she remembers how the three panel judges \u2013 all elderly men \u2013 reacted. \u201cThey asked things like: \u2018What did you do to provoke him?\u2019\u201d Her husband had been restricted by the court to supervised contact with their children because of his violence, yet the judges insisted on talking about access. \u201cAll they cared about was his relationship with the children \u2013 not their safety, or my safety.\u201d Amara dropped the case, but later approached the Muslim College in Ealing. This, she says, \u201cwas a completely different experience\u201d. Her case was dealt with in writing, professionally, and resolved within a few months. One pressing problem is the increasing number of Muslim couples who are at the mercy of sharia councils because they have had religious ceremonies to mark their marriage but are not legally married under UK law. There is no central registry of Islamic marriages (marriages do not have to take place in a mosque, and you do not need an imam), so it is impossible to know how many couples have had only religious services \u2013 Aina Khan, a lawyer and campaigner, has estimated that there could be 100,000 couples in Britain (under the current Marriage Act, only Anglicans, Quakers and Jews are obliged to register their marriage). \u201cIn the past five years there has been a steep increase [in couples having only religious marriages]. It used to be about half [of my clients], now it has crept up to 80%,\u201d says Khan. Some couples intend to have a civil service at a later date, others do not realise an Islamic marriage undertaken in the UK is not legally recognised; some feel it is only a religious marriage that is important to them. Khan says she has also seen an increase in men wanting to avoid losing money or property in a divorce. \u201cInstead of a prenuptial agreement, men are refusing a legal marriage. Women are worried about losing their rishta [marriage proposal] so they say: \u2018OK\u2019.\u201d Yet this means these Muslim women do not have legal protection, even if they have given up work to look after children. Women risk being turned out of their homes with nothing if their marriages break down \u2013 the Casey Review explains that this can be particularly worrying with the \u201clower levels of female employment, lower levels of English language and, anecdotally at least, a lack of awareness of other civil rights\u201d in Muslim communities. Muslim women who have civil marriages will need a civil divorce too. But those with no civil marriage have to turn to sharia councils and risk being left in limbo for years. Khan says one of her clients had started a new relationship and was pregnant with a child with still no sign of her Islamic divorce from the sharia council she applied to. Khan fears councils are becoming increasingly misogynistic and inefficient. \u201cSadly they have become a victim of their own success \u2013 they are overworked. The Salafi [ultra-conservative] influence on religion has brought in a real misogyny. They have become more hardline and anti-female.\u201d This can be seen in the most frightening complaint against sharia councils \u2013 that with divorce permissible but discouraged by Islam, women are pressured into mediation with violent partners \u2013 or even reconciliation. Savin Bapir-Tarvey, a psychologist with the Iranian and Kurdish Women\u2019s Rights Organisation (IKWRO), sees around 15 clients a week, many of whom are extremely vulnerable. She says cultural concepts such as honour are used to manipulate women. \u201cThey have experienced severe abuse and their children have witnessed it,\u201d she says, but they are told that \u201cto leave would bring shame on the family\u201d. Even marital rape can be ignored. \u201cWomen who have been through FGM might not make that clear [to their new husbands], but they might say they don\u2019t want to have sex. One woman was told it was her duty \u2013 and she should pray while her husband has sex with her \u2013 basically while he raped her.\u201d Bone is clear on the subject of domestic violence: \u201cThe Islamic fundamental of marriage is that a woman should feel safe.\u201d If there was violence, \u201cwe would go straight ahead and dissolve it\u201d. She also disputes another criticism \u2013 that a woman\u2019s testimony at a sharia council is given half the weight of a man\u2019s, insisting that this is not true in her council and is a misinterpretation of sharia law in general. Over at the well known Islamic Cultural Centre and London Central mosque in Regent\u2019s Park, director Ahmad al-Dubayan is trying to reform councils from within. It has set up a board of sharia councils \u2013 18 so far \u2013 with a code of conduct. Dubayan tells me he would like to see less expensive, fairer charges for Islamic divorces (some women pay \u00a3400, men considerably less) and an end to delays. He says many Muslims do not understand their marriage rights under Islamic law and that they are putting together a manual to rectify this. There are certainly good experiences amid the horror stories. Khatija from the East Midlands tells me that when she was pregnant with her second child in 2003, she began civil divorce proceedings for coercive control, but her husband defended it. \u201cAt that point, coercive control was not a separate offence [in English law]. The judge was appalling. He told me I didn\u2019t seem to have enough reason for a divorce.\u201d Khatija was told to wait until the pair had been separated for five years \u2013 which took until 2009. It was the sharia council in Dewsbury, she says, who took the abuse seriously, arranging an Islamic divorce in a matter of months. \u201cThe imam I dealt with was very, very kind. I explained how I wasn\u2019t allowed out of the house, even when I was with my parents in the UK [her husband lived abroad] \u2013 he would still control me. Before I went out, I would have to ring to check with him.\u201d Southall Black Sisters, however, is firm in its opposition. Religion and family law are too dangerous a mix to allow sharia councils to continue to operate. \u201cReligion inherently discriminates against women,\u201d stresses director Pragna Patel. \u201cYou cannot access justice if the people who are violating your rights are dispensing it.\u201d Along with other secular women\u2019s groups, it has boycotted the government inquiry, pointing out that it is headed by a theologian rather than a judge, and has Islamic scholars in place of human rights experts. Sharia council supporters point out that women choose to have Islamic divorces of their own free will yet Patel says this ignores the fact that they do so to avoid being \u201ctreated as outcasts\u201d by conservative communities, who view divorce as shameful. Bano agrees that state law, however imperfect, \u201cis the only system that Muslim and vulnerable women have for protection\u201d and \u201cin family law matters or in issues of vulnerability and marginalisation we should never have a delegation into the community\u201d. IKWRO is considering another way to take on sharia councils. They are looking for a test case to prove that \u201cmarital captivity\u201d \u2013 refusing to give a woman a religious divorce \u2013 is a form of forced marriage.

      "bodyText": "Late-night hosts discussed Donald Trump\u2019s speech to Congress, as Stephen Colbert asked: \u201cAny chance there\u2019s a mistake and Moonlight is the president?\u201d On The Late Show, Colbert went live to discuss the address, noting that some attendees had worn special clothing just for the occasion. \u201cThe female members of the house Democratic caucus all wore white in honor of women\u2019s suffrage, while the Republicans were white in honor of who elected them,\u201d he joked. As Trump entered, Colbert noted: \u201cSo many handshakes, such little hands.\u201d Trump\u2019s new slogan from the speech appeared to be \u201cRenewal of the American Spirit\u201d, which Colbert said \u201csounds like a Chinese bootleg of Make America Great Again\u201d. The president went on to describe how he intended to add more government taskforces as a way of somehow reducing staff. Colbert joked: \u201cIt\u2019s like how the key to not being hungover is just to never stop drinking.\u201d With regards to immigration, Trump claimed the \u201cbad ones\u201d were being removed while those who intended to live in the US had to show that they could provide for themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s just like the Statue of Liberty says: give us your tired, your poor, but not so poor that they can\u2019t afford a two-bedroom apartment and like, a Mitsubishi,\u201d Colbert said. Trump spoke about the mess he had inherited, which led Colbert to joke: \u201cI don\u2019t know what we inherited, but you inherited like $100m.\u201d Trump went on to say that any problem the country has can be fixed. Colbert agreed but added: \u201cWell, there\u2019s one problem we can\u2019t solve for four years.\u201d On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah brought up a recent town hall meeting that saw a surprisingly young member of the audience ask a question attacking Senator Tom Cotton. \u201cTrump\u2019s America is the only place you\u2019ll see a seven-year-old show up with talking points,\u201d he said. Noah added: \u201cYou know you fucked up when even the little kids are coming hard at you. \u201cNow some people might say: \u2018Why the hell is a kid participating? He\u2019s not even old enough to vote.\u2019 But let me tell you something, when you have a president who thinks global warming is a hoax, he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll ever get the chance to vote in the future, so that kid is like: \u2018I\u2019m gonna do my shit now,\u2019\u201d he said. On The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon spoke about the 3,500-word letter sent to Trump by the former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He doubted Trump had read it because, as he said in character: \u201cI haven\u2019t even read my immigration policy.\u201d Trump has come under fire for his commerce secretary pick, who is the vice-chairman of a bank owned by Vladimir Putin. \u201cYou can tell the bank is owned by Putin because both the pens and the tellers are chained to the desks,\u201d he said. He then took aim at the viral picture of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway sitting in the Oval Office in a strange, overly comfortable manner, shoes on the sofa. \u201cKellyanne says that they\u2019re not shoes, they\u2019re alternative socks,\u201d he joked. He then spoke about rumors that Trump would cancel the annual Easter egg roll. In character, he said: \u201cActually I\u2019m canceling all egg rolls to get back at China.\u201d",

If you\u2019ve ever been told something is stored or run \u201cin the cloud\u201d, the likelihood is that it was in servers owned by Amazon \u2013 or by similar services provided by its two main competitors, Microsoft and Google.</p> <p>When that model works, it works brilliantly, providing low barrier to entry for small firms needing an online presence, economies of scale for larger companies warning world-class hosting \u2013 and huge profits for Amazon itself. In the last year, thecompany has pulled in profit of $2.4bn overall, but AWS alone made a profit of $3.1bn (the missing billions are a result of how much money the company continues to lose in international sales).</p> <p>When it doesn\u2019t work, everything comes crashing down. Subscribers, and the wider web, first got a hint that something was up around 6pm UK time, as glitches began to hit websites and apps that use Amazon\u2019s cloud storage and computing. It took slightly longer than might be expected when a huge tranche of the net collapses simultaneously for the common cause to be diagnosed, though.</p> <p>In part, that\u2019s because Amazon\u2019s data centres are distributed around the world.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a cautionary tale about the future of the internet: an over three-hour outage in an obscure, if tremendously profitable, wing of online retailer Amazon resulted not only in websites such as Medium and Business Insider failing, but also in people unable to turn on their lights. This outage affected Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon subsidiary that provides cloud computing services to other businesses. If you\u2019ve ever been told something is stored or run \u201cin the cloud\u201d, the likelihood is that it was in servers owned by Amazon \u2013 or by similar services provided by its two main competitors, Microsoft and Google. When that model works, it works brilliantly, providing low barrier to entry for small firms needing an online presence, economies of scale for larger companies warning world-class hosting \u2013 and huge profits for Amazon itself. In the last year, thecompany has pulled in profit of $2.4bn overall, but AWS alone made a profit of $3.1bn (the missing billions are a result of how much money the company continues to lose in international sales). When it doesn\u2019t work, everything comes crashing down. Subscribers, and the wider web, first got a hint that something was up around 6pm UK time, as glitches began to hit websites and apps that use Amazon\u2019s cloud storage and computing. It took slightly longer than might be expected when a huge tranche of the net collapses simultaneously for the common cause to be diagnosed, though. In part, that\u2019s because Amazon\u2019s data centres are distributed around the world. Only its \u201cUS East\u201d region, based in north Virginia, was hit, sparing customers \u2013 like the Guardian \u2013 who use their cloud services elsewhere in the world. (The majority of the Guardian\u2019s use of AWS, for distributed publishing tools, is based in Amazon\u2019s Dublin centre; some interactive visuals were hosted from Virginia, however, leading to downtime and delays). The US-East region does contain some of the company\u2019s most visible customers, however, in part because it\u2019s the natural region for America\u2019s largely east coast-based publishing industry. It also contains a couple of other customers which helped hide the scale of the outage for many: downtime-monitoring service downforeveryoneorjustme.com, which lets users see whether a particular site is offline or not, was down for everyone. Worse still, Amazon\u2019s own monitoring tools were broken. The company\u2019s Service Health Dashboard reported everything fine across the board, until engineers managed to fix the first problem of the day and update the system to display the many, many other problems ongoing. A short internet outage might sound like a trifling matter \u2013 don\u2019t we all need a little bit of time offline now and then? \u2013 but for many, the pervasiveness of the so-called \u201cinternet of things\u201d meant downtime at Amazon affected their physical life as well as their digital one. Ifttt, a website which allows users to link together services from multiple providers into one seamless operation, was one of the Amazon customers knocked offline by the outage. For some, that simply meant that their workflows were disrupted, with emails not being forwarded or weather summaries not being automatically emailed. For others, that meant slightly more drastic problems: \u201csmart home\u201d owners reported losing control of their houses after the jury-rigged system they used to control internet-connected locks and light bulbs failed. As Amazon Web Services, and its cloud-computing competitors, have grown larger, some have asked whether their sheer scale is posing a threat to the stability of the internet itself.

Then we ran out of Tin and read the paper more closely, noticing it was several months old and the monks in question are of the Buddhist kidney and have been travelling regularly to Leicester for a long time now, on loan from the Wat Traimit Withayaram Woraviharn Temple in Bangkok. Make no mistake, these are top, top prayers.</p> <p>Even though The Foxes and Monks could be the name of one of those pubs from which The Fiver is barred, we can\u2019t claim to know any details whatsoever about the exchanges that have taken place between Leicester\u2019s players and their spiritual helpers. Perhaps a more contemplative strain of b@ntz has taken root in Leicester\u2019s changing room and, say, Robert Huth has been going around since the defrocking of Claudio Ranieri and sticking pointed quotes from the Buddha on the backs of certain players. Stuff such as: \u201cThe evil deeds were only done by you, not by your parents, friends or relatives; and you yourself will reap the painful results.\u201d</p> <p>All we can say for sure is that, thanks to their berobed guests, Leicester players must be well aware of the concept of karma. Which means that they may figure that there is, in fact, an understandable explanation for the news that made us spew a whole new can of Tin all over today\u2019s Big Paper: Leicester City have only gone and held talks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/feb/28/roy-hodgson-leicester-city-manager-england\">about hiring Mr Roy as manager</a>!</p> <p>The Fiver\u2019s immediate reaction to hearing this news was to blurt: \u201cMr Roy is a total stick!\u201d Yes, stick. Because if Leicester\u2019s players have in the past been offered an abundance of carrots in the form of, um, pizzas, cars and bumper new contracts, it seems that now is the time for them to be threatened with a complete stick. If they don\u2019t perform for Craig Shakespeare, they could be handed over to Mr Roy. Fearless? The Foxes shouldn\u2019t be.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Jacob Steinberg from 6.30pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Barcelona 2-1 Sporting Gij\u00f3n, while Paul Doyle will be on hand for Manchester City 2-0 Huddersfield in their FA Cup replay at 8pm</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cI always told myself: never replace a coach by sitting in his chair yourself.

That way, either one triumphant representative of the winning team can easily hoist it aloft or, in the latter\u2019s case, two representatives (eg the captain, long-serving manager, and/or Plain Old John Terry) can lift it together.

      "bodyText": "\u2018SO TURN AROUND AND I\u2019LL PICK UP THE SLACK\u2019 When The Fiver read that Leicester City\u2019s owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, had arranged for several monks to visit the King Power Stadium and talk to the club\u2019s players, spreading calm and righteous vibes, we wondered just what the hell had come over the manager of Nasty Leeds and his family. Then we ran out of Tin and read the paper more closely, noticing it was several months old and the monks in question are of the Buddhist kidney and have been travelling regularly to Leicester for a long time now, on loan from the Wat Traimit Withayaram Woraviharn Temple in Bangkok. Make no mistake, these are top, top prayers. Even though The Foxes and Monks could be the name of one of those pubs from which The Fiver is barred, we can\u2019t claim to know any details whatsoever about the exchanges that have taken place between Leicester\u2019s players and their spiritual helpers. Perhaps a more contemplative strain of b@ntz has taken root in Leicester\u2019s changing room and, say, Robert Huth has been going around since the defrocking of Claudio Ranieri and sticking pointed quotes from the Buddha on the backs of certain players. Stuff such as: \u201cThe evil deeds were only done by you, not by your parents, friends or relatives; and you yourself will reap the painful results.\u201d All we can say for sure is that, thanks to their berobed guests, Leicester players must be well aware of the concept of karma. Which means that they may figure that there is, in fact, an understandable explanation for the news that made us spew a whole new can of Tin all over today\u2019s Big Paper: Leicester City have only gone and held talks about hiring Mr Roy as manager! The Fiver\u2019s immediate reaction to hearing this news was to blurt: \u201cMr Roy is a total stick!\u201d Yes, stick. Because if Leicester\u2019s players have in the past been offered an abundance of carrots in the form of, um, pizzas, cars and bumper new contracts, it seems that now is the time for them to be threatened with a complete stick. If they don\u2019t perform for Craig Shakespeare, they could be handed over to Mr Roy. Fearless? The Foxes shouldn\u2019t be.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI always told myself: never replace a coach by sitting in his chair yourself. It is not the correct thing to do. It brings bad energy.

      "body": "<p>On a Wednesday afternoon at Beaumont hospital in Royal Oak, on the outskirts of Detroit, a blind 25-year-old man with autism plays piano near the hospital entrance. Doctors, patients, nurses and families crowd around Lance Vardon, who is seated at a grand piano playing Bach\u2019s Prelude in C Major.</p> <p>Three days a week, the same group gathers around the grand piano during their lunch hour. Vardon launches into Journey\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop Believing with his music therapist Lisa Barnett, who has worked with the young man for 16 years. Seated together at the grand piano, Vardon plays one hand of keys and Barnett, who sings, plays the other. The small crowd soon doubles in size.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jun/26/as-a-music-therapist-i-can-give-people-back-the-power-to-communicate\">As a music therapist I can give people back the power to communicate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Vardon, who was born to deaf parents, music speaks louder than words. Diagnosed with autism at age seven, he has a severe case with limited verbal communication. He can answer yes or no, but he can\u2019t verbalize his feelings. Barnett has worked with him to increase his ability to socialize and be more independent. That\u2019s the aim of music therapy: to reach goals, which can be physical, emotional or cognitive, for those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which leads to difficulty communicating and forming relationships.</p> <p>Clinicians have observed that people with autism can use improvised music to express emotion effectively. According to preliminary research not yet published, Edward Roth, director and professor of music therapy at Western Michigan University, says children who were put into a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner while improvising or listening to someone improvise music showed activity in the parts of the brain involved with communication.</p> <p>\u201cIf you were to look at those brains, you couldn\u2019t tell the difference between people who were interacting through music and people who were interacting verbally,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re having a nonverbal discussion through music \u2013 and these aren\u2019t musicians, these are musically naive children.\u201d</p> <p>Another test involved taking blood from college students before and after singing both improvised and composed music. Results for composed music showed a decrease in stress hormones, and results for improvised music showed a decrease in stress hormones and an increase in oxytocin, which is thought to be a marker of bonding and trust. <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00518/full\">According to the study</a>, which was published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, the results indicate that group singing reduces stress and arousal and induces social flow in participants.</p> <p>The social aspect of creative arts therapies such as music are highly beneficial for disabled children and young adults. At Michigan State University, 4th Wall Theatre Company \u2013 which has classes all over the state \u2013 puts on theater programs that include singing, dancing and acting. </p> <p>One participant, 21-year-old Christopher Hibbs, has pervasive developmental disorder on the autism spectrum and wants to be a professional actor. His mother Martha says the class has helped him come out of his shell. \u201cIt brings kids joy and shows them what they can do,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gives them a sense of accomplishment.\u201d Now several programs in, Hibbs has become more aware of other people and their disabilities, which has helped him learn empathy. (Areas of the brain associated with empathy showed activity in the fMRI tests, too.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7cbed17ea45675d5e1d3c0f7bc526c74c9d43d57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cbed17ea45675d5e1d3c0f7bc526c74c9d43d57/0_69_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Mann, co-founder of 4th Wall, leads a theater class at Michigan State University.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie Mann, co-founder of 4th Wall, leads a theater class at Michigan State University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Quang Pham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like Hibbs, Vardon has come a long way. The teaching process is long and laborious, according to Barnett: she sings into a cassette tape recorder, which Vardon then plays back, learning through imitation. Songs can take months to learn. He won\u2019t respond to MP3s, either: only cassette tapes recorded via an old-fashioned karaoke machine. His favorite music to play is new age, baroque and Disney. Recently, he learned City of Stars from La La Land, but his go-to is Leonard Cohen\u2019s Hallelujah. The strongest suit for children with autism is visual, so Vardon learns with braille books that have instructions; step-by-step structure is essential for those with autism.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a role model for other kids,\u201d says Barnett, who received a degree in music therapy from Michigan State University and has a company called Songs to Grow On that works with clients from the age of seven through their late 50s, both disabled and able-bodied. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the reasons I keep doing this every day, because he\u2019s a remarkable human being.\u201d In high school, Vardon played with his school orchestra before playing the prestigious Carnegie Hall.</p> <p>Vardon communicates with his parents through finger spelling, which is signing letters into the palms of hands. Judy and Larry can\u2019t hear the music their son plays, but they can see it and feel it. \u201cI see people who love music and they\u2019re my ear and my sound,\u201d says Judy Vardon, who speaks in sign language translated by her 27-year-old son, Stefan. \u201cPeople used to walk away and now they come up to us. We\u2019re different, but we\u2019re not going to bite you.\u201d</p> <p>In 2005, a year after the family appeared on ABC\u2019s Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, Stevie Wonder came knocking on their door. Wonder had a unique connection with Vardon: he gave him a guitar and they hung out for hours. \u201cI know Lance isn\u2019t a world-famous musician, but I feel proud,\u201d Judy says. \u201cStevie is Motown.\u201d</p> <p>It was clear early on that Vardon loved music. At eight months old, Vardon played with a toy piano in the bathtub. He then became fascinated with wind chimes. He was so drawn to the sound that he began to wander outside looking for them. One day, at the age of six, he got extremely upset and his parents couldn\u2019t figure out why. It turns out one of the wind chimes was missing and he could sense its absence.</p> <p>\u201cI remember we were in a restaurant when we were little \u2026 everyone was looking at us: Lance was copying Bing Cosby\u2019s voice and singing along to White Christmas,\u201d recalls Stefan Vardon. \u201cI realized he had some sort of talent with music, and we encouraged him.\u201d Vardon also knows three languages \u2013 English, sign language and Spanish \u2013 and is an avid reader. \u201cHe understands so much,\u201d Barnett says. \u201cHe just can\u2019t verbalize it.\u201d</p> <p>Vardon is considered to be in an adult transition program, which helps prepare young adults for independent lives. His volunteer work at Beaumont is part of that program. But when he turns 26, he\u2019ll no longer qualify for special needs services provided by the state of Michigan, which is the only state in the country to provide services up to that age. With cuts and constant changes in funding for music therapy, Barnett isn\u2019t sure what will happen because she\u2019ll no longer be funded through the school district to be at the hospital. Vardon\u2019s musical future will rest in the hands of his parents and outside organizations. </p> <p>\u201cThis should be his theme song,\u201d jokes Barnett, nearing the end of Don\u2019t Stop Believing. \u201cYou guys like Journey?\u201d she asks the crowd, urging them to sing along. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna rock out now!\u201d</p> <p>Vardon, face scrunched up in concentration, brings the song to a close \u2013 except for the very last note. \u201cFinish the song, Lance!\u201d Barnett exclaims. His fingers hover over the keys for a brief moment before dropping them down in a grand conclusion. Vardon smiles, leans back and gets ready to shake hands with the line of admirers waiting to tell him: \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a Wednesday afternoon at Beaumont hospital in Royal Oak, on the outskirts of Detroit, a blind 25-year-old man with autism plays piano near the hospital entrance. Doctors, patients, nurses and families crowd around Lance Vardon, who is seated at a grand piano playing Bach\u2019s Prelude in C Major. Three days a week, the same group gathers around the grand piano during their lunch hour. Vardon launches into Journey\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop Believing with his music therapist Lisa Barnett, who has worked with the young man for 16 years. Seated together at the grand piano, Vardon plays one hand of keys and Barnett, who sings, plays the other. The small crowd soon doubles in size. For Vardon, who was born to deaf parents, music speaks louder than words. Diagnosed with autism at age seven, he has a severe case with limited verbal communication. He can answer yes or no, but he can\u2019t verbalize his feelings. Barnett has worked with him to increase his ability to socialize and be more independent. That\u2019s the aim of music therapy: to reach goals, which can be physical, emotional or cognitive, for those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which leads to difficulty communicating and forming relationships. Clinicians have observed that people with autism can use improvised music to express emotion effectively. According to preliminary research not yet published, Edward Roth, director and professor of music therapy at Western Michigan University, says children who were put into a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner while improvising or listening to someone improvise music showed activity in the parts of the brain involved with communication. \u201cIf you were to look at those brains, you couldn\u2019t tell the difference between people who were interacting through music and people who were interacting verbally,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re having a nonverbal discussion through music \u2013 and these aren\u2019t musicians, these are musically naive children.\u201d Another test involved taking blood from college students before and after singing both improvised and composed music. Results for composed music showed a decrease in stress hormones, and results for improvised music showed a decrease in stress hormones and an increase in oxytocin, which is thought to be a marker of bonding and trust. According to the study, which was published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, the results indicate that group singing reduces stress and arousal and induces social flow in participants. The social aspect of creative arts therapies such as music are highly beneficial for disabled children and young adults. At Michigan State University, 4th Wall Theatre Company \u2013 which has classes all over the state \u2013 puts on theater programs that include singing, dancing and acting. One participant, 21-year-old Christopher Hibbs, has pervasive developmental disorder on the autism spectrum and wants to be a professional actor. His mother Martha says the class has helped him come out of his shell. \u201cIt brings kids joy and shows them what they can do,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gives them a sense of accomplishment.\u201d Now several programs in, Hibbs has become more aware of other people and their disabilities, which has helped him learn empathy. (Areas of the brain associated with empathy showed activity in the fMRI tests, too.) Like Hibbs, Vardon has come a long way. The teaching process is long and laborious, according to Barnett: she sings into a cassette tape recorder, which Vardon then plays back, learning through imitation. Songs can take months to learn. He won\u2019t respond to MP3s, either: only cassette tapes recorded via an old-fashioned karaoke machine. His favorite music to play is new age, baroque and Disney. Recently, he learned City of Stars from La La Land, but his go-to is Leonard Cohen\u2019s Hallelujah. The strongest suit for children with autism is visual, so Vardon learns with braille books that have instructions; step-by-step structure is essential for those with autism. \u201cHe\u2019s a role model for other kids,\u201d says Barnett, who received a degree in music therapy from Michigan State University and has a company called Songs to Grow On that works with clients from the age of seven through their late 50s, both disabled and able-bodied. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the reasons I keep doing this every day, because he\u2019s a remarkable human being.\u201d In high school, Vardon played with his school orchestra before playing the prestigious Carnegie Hall. Vardon communicates with his parents through finger spelling, which is signing letters into the palms of hands. Judy and Larry can\u2019t hear the music their son plays, but they can see it and feel it. \u201cI see people who love music and they\u2019re my ear and my sound,\u201d says Judy Vardon, who speaks in sign language translated by her 27-year-old son, Stefan. \u201cPeople used to walk away and now they come up to us. We\u2019re different, but we\u2019re not going to bite you.\u201d In 2005, a year after the family appeared on ABC\u2019s Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, Stevie Wonder came knocking on their door. Wonder had a unique connection with Vardon: he gave him a guitar and they hung out for hours. \u201cI know Lance isn\u2019t a world-famous musician, but I feel proud,\u201d Judy says. \u201cStevie is Motown.\u201d It was clear early on that Vardon loved music. At eight months old, Vardon played with a toy piano in the bathtub. He then became fascinated with wind chimes. He was so drawn to the sound that he began to wander outside looking for them. One day, at the age of six, he got extremely upset and his parents couldn\u2019t figure out why. It turns out one of the wind chimes was missing and he could sense its absence. \u201cI remember we were in a restaurant when we were little \u2026 everyone was looking at us: Lance was copying Bing Cosby\u2019s voice and singing along to White Christmas,\u201d recalls Stefan Vardon. \u201cI realized he had some sort of talent with music, and we encouraged him.\u201d Vardon also knows three languages \u2013 English, sign language and Spanish \u2013 and is an avid reader. \u201cHe understands so much,\u201d Barnett says. \u201cHe just can\u2019t verbalize it.\u201d Vardon is considered to be in an adult transition program, which helps prepare young adults for independent lives. His volunteer work at Beaumont is part of that program. But when he turns 26, he\u2019ll no longer qualify for special needs services provided by the state of Michigan, which is the only state in the country to provide services up to that age. With cuts and constant changes in funding for music therapy, Barnett isn\u2019t sure what will happen because she\u2019ll no longer be funded through the school district to be at the hospital. Vardon\u2019s musical future will rest in the hands of his parents and outside organizations. \u201cThis should be his theme song,\u201d jokes Barnett, nearing the end of Don\u2019t Stop Believing. \u201cYou guys like Journey?\u201d she asks the crowd, urging them to sing along. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna rock out now!\u201d Vardon, face scrunched up in concentration, brings the song to a close \u2013 except for the very last note. \u201cFinish the song, Lance!\u201d Barnett exclaims. His fingers hover over the keys for a brief moment before dropping them down in a grand conclusion. Vardon smiles, leans back and gets ready to shake hands with the line of admirers waiting to tell him: \u201cThank you.\u201d",

But these very surface jokes are set against Kendrick\u2019s angst and Squibb\u2019s melancholy. We quickly learn that one is pregnant and the other is dying and that Kudrow and Robinson haven\u2019t made love in years. Will getting stuck at table 19 somehow make this all right in the end? A moody montage set to knockoff Bon Iver-style echoey music ought to answer that question. I\u2019d like to make it clear that there are the occasional bright spots in this movie. Anna Kendrick (whom I adored in another matrimonial film, the spectacular Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates) has great comedy timing and is always sympathetic. Craig Robinson, who gave a striking performance in last year\u2019s Morris From America, is also quite likable. That\u2019s why it is so, so frustrating to watch them drown in a shambles of a production like this. Go with your gut reaction: find an excuse to be busy when this invitation comes. Table 19 is released in US cinemas on 3 March and in UK cinemas on 7 April",

Opposition parties simply do not lose byelections to governing parties. Yes, Labour\u2019s support has been in decline in the constituency since 1997; and we know that working-class disillusionment kicked in under New Labour. But wasn\u2019t the whole point of the Jeremy Corbyn project to reverse that trend, not have a further dramatic drop of support just two years after the last general election? And while Labour activists in Stoke should beam with pride for routing Ukip, there, too, there was a swing to the Tories.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/28/dont-blame-corbyn-sins-blair-brown-new-labour\">Don\u2019t blame Corbyn for the sins of Blair, Brown and New Labour | Ken Loach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The polling for Labour is catastrophic. Veteran pollster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/24/stoke-copeland-labour-remain-richmond-copeland-ukip\" title=\"\">John Curtice</a> says the swing to the Tories in Copeland is even more dramatic than national opinion surveys suggest. Yes, polls can be wrong: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/13/new-research-general-election-polls-inaccurate\" title=\"\">2015</a> and 1992 represent the two big polling disasters of our time. Yet in both cases, the disaster was overestimating Labour\u2019s lead. If the current polling is wrong in any meaningful way, precedent suggests the real picture is even worse for Labour.</p> <p>And if Labour loses the next election a rightwing Tory government, infused with an increasingly xenophobic and authoritarian brand of populism, will have a whopping, unassailable majority. Corbyn will certainly resign. The left will be blamed for breaking the Labour party. Several leftwing MPs will lose their seats. The remaining MPs will certainly not nominate any candidate on the left. The party will hurtle off to the right.</p> <p>Those who fear the fall of Corbyn will open the door to New Labour-style politics should realise that a calamitous election defeat is the way to guarantee it.</p> <p>Those currently turning away from Labour are not doing so because the party wants to invest in the economy rather than cut, or introduce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/16/jeremy-corbyn-to-confront-big-business-over-living-wage\" title=\"\">a genuine living wage</a>, or return <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/07/jeremy-corbyn-raise-tax-pay-rise-public-sector-labour\" title=\"\">public services</a> and utilities into the hands of the British people, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/30/jeremy-corbyn-strengthening-workers-rights-labour-priority\" title=\"\">increase workers\u2019 rights</a>. All of these policies are supported by millions.</p> <p>But a terrible defeat for Labour will be spun as a rejection of the policies Corbyn supporters rightly champion. They will be buried in the rubble. Every time anyone proposes these ideas, the response will be: \u201cBut Labour supported those under Corbyn, didn\u2019t it, and it ended in disaster.\u201d Britain in the aftermath of a calamitous Labour defeat will be intoxicated with Tory triumphalism, and will be an oppressive place for any vaguely progressive views.</p> <p>Political debate in Britain \u2013 and much of the wider western world \u2013 is toxic and angry. That includes within Labour and the wider left. The party\u2019s warring factions now refuse to accept that differing opinions are expressed in good faith \u2013 there have to be ulterior motives, ranging from careerism to self-aggrandisement to \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d. When, during the last Labour leadership election, I posed <a href=\"https://medium.com/@OwenJones84/questions-all-jeremy-corbyn-supporters-need-to-answer-b3e82ace7ed3#.mgt8zpn4k\" title=\"\">critical questions</a> for Corbyn supporters, one senior leftwing figure told me I had resigned from the left. Others on the left claim media brainwashing is chiefly responsible for Tory victories.</p> <p>On the other hand, the militant anti-Corbynistas show little understanding as to why they lost in the first place. They also believe media brainwashing gifted Corbyn the leadership, albeit from leftwing newspaper columnists. Labour\u2019s electoral system, which helped grant Corbyn victory, was designed under pressure from the party\u2019s right. They believed it would dilute the influence of the unions, encouraging more representative members of the electorate to join and support candidates closer to the \u201ccentre ground\u201d. Corbyn didn\u2019t win in 2015; his opponents lost. They had no compelling or coherent alternative, and couldn\u2019t inspire members of their own party \u2013 let alone the wider public \u2013 to vote for them. They left a vacuum, and it was filled.</p> <p>That remains the case, as the more perceptive among their ranks recognise. The less perceptive have become embittered nihilists, defined almost exclusively by hostility to the left. In fact, Corbyn\u2019s victory was just another example of the wildly differing manifestations of the discontent sweeping the western world \u2013 from Trump to Sanders, from the Scottish independence movement to the French Front National, from Spain\u2019s Podemos to Austria\u2019s far-right.</p> <p>Corbyn is a man of principle who has repeatedly been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/jeremy-corbyn-leadership-david-cameron-libya-labour\" title=\"\">on the right side of history</a>. He was arrested for campaigning against apartheid when Margaret Thatcher was <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/margaret-thatcher-branded-anc-terrorist-while-urging-nelson-mandela-s-release-8994191.html\" title=\"\">denouncing the ANC as terrorists</a>; he supported LGBT rights when it was \u201cloony left\u201d to do so; he campaigned against Saddam Hussein when our government armed the murderous despot; he later opposed the Iraq war. On the big issues of the day \u2013 such as public investment in our economy, tax justice, workers\u2019 rights, the housing crisis, the NHS \u2013 he is absolutely right.</p> <p>Corbyn is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/28/dont-blame-corbyn-sins-blair-brown-new-labour\" title=\"\">not responsible for all of Labour\u2019s ills</a> \u2013 far from it. The party is beset by a multitude of structural problems: the crisis of social democratic and centre-left parties across the western world; the post-Brexit division in its electoral coalition between working-class voters in small towns and university-educated voters in big cities; a widening generational divide in voting; and the failure of his predecessors to defend Labour\u2019s record on spending, which continues to undermine the case for investment. These are underlying problems predating Corbyn.</p> <p>Yet the leadership has not only failed to address them, but actually made many of them worse. Of course it\u2019s correct, as Corbyn\u2019s supporters often point out, that Britain\u2019s press is owned by an aggressively rightwing cabal who demonise anyone who even vaguely challenges the status quo. But there needs to be a sophisticated strategy to deal with such entrenched opposition; it has been sorely lacking.</p> <p>And his supporters are right to say that last year\u2019s shambolic coup attempt damaged the party: it was both outrageous and the mark of a farcical absence of political strategy to cripple the opposition at a time of national crisis immediately after the Brexit vote. It undoubtedly has impacted on Labour\u2019s polling.

      "bodyText": "There is no pussyfooting around Labour\u2019s Copeland rout. Opposition parties simply do not lose byelections to governing parties. Yes, Labour\u2019s support has been in decline in the constituency since 1997; and we know that working-class disillusionment kicked in under New Labour. But wasn\u2019t the whole point of the Jeremy Corbyn project to reverse that trend, not have a further dramatic drop of support just two years after the last general election? And while Labour activists in Stoke should beam with pride for routing Ukip, there, too, there was a swing to the Tories. The polling for Labour is catastrophic. Veteran pollster John Curtice says the swing to the Tories in Copeland is even more dramatic than national opinion surveys suggest. Yes, polls can be wrong: 2015 and 1992 represent the two big polling disasters of our time. Yet in both cases, the disaster was overestimating Labour\u2019s lead. If the current polling is wrong in any meaningful way, precedent suggests the real picture is even worse for Labour. And if Labour loses the next election a rightwing Tory government, infused with an increasingly xenophobic and authoritarian brand of populism, will have a whopping, unassailable majority. Corbyn will certainly resign. The left will be blamed for breaking the Labour party. Several leftwing MPs will lose their seats. The remaining MPs will certainly not nominate any candidate on the left. The party will hurtle off to the right. Those who fear the fall of Corbyn will open the door to New Labour-style politics should realise that a calamitous election defeat is the way to guarantee it. Those currently turning away from Labour are not doing so because the party wants to invest in the economy rather than cut, or introduce a genuine living wage, or return public services and utilities into the hands of the British people, or increase workers\u2019 rights. All of these policies are supported by millions. But a terrible defeat for Labour will be spun as a rejection of the policies Corbyn supporters rightly champion. They will be buried in the rubble. Every time anyone proposes these ideas, the response will be: \u201cBut Labour supported those under Corbyn, didn\u2019t it, and it ended in disaster.\u201d Britain in the aftermath of a calamitous Labour defeat will be intoxicated with Tory triumphalism, and will be an oppressive place for any vaguely progressive views. Political debate in Britain \u2013 and much of the wider western world \u2013 is toxic and angry. That includes within Labour and the wider left. The party\u2019s warring factions now refuse to accept that differing opinions are expressed in good faith \u2013 there have to be ulterior motives, ranging from careerism to self-aggrandisement to \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d. When, during the last Labour leadership election, I posed critical questions for Corbyn supporters, one senior leftwing figure told me I had resigned from the left. Others on the left claim media brainwashing is chiefly responsible for Tory victories. On the other hand, the militant anti-Corbynistas show little understanding as to why they lost in the first place. They also believe media brainwashing gifted Corbyn the leadership, albeit from leftwing newspaper columnists. Labour\u2019s electoral system, which helped grant Corbyn victory, was designed under pressure from the party\u2019s right. They believed it would dilute the influence of the unions, encouraging more representative members of the electorate to join and support candidates closer to the \u201ccentre ground\u201d. Corbyn didn\u2019t win in 2015; his opponents lost. They had no compelling or coherent alternative, and couldn\u2019t inspire members of their own party \u2013 let alone the wider public \u2013 to vote for them. They left a vacuum, and it was filled. That remains the case, as the more perceptive among their ranks recognise. The less perceptive have become embittered nihilists, defined almost exclusively by hostility to the left. In fact, Corbyn\u2019s victory was just another example of the wildly differing manifestations of the discontent sweeping the western world \u2013 from Trump to Sanders, from the Scottish independence movement to the French Front National, from Spain\u2019s Podemos to Austria\u2019s far-right. Corbyn is a man of principle who has repeatedly been on the right side of history. He was arrested for campaigning against apartheid when Margaret Thatcher was denouncing the ANC as terrorists; he supported LGBT rights when it was \u201cloony left\u201d to do so; he campaigned against Saddam Hussein when our government armed the murderous despot; he later opposed the Iraq war. On the big issues of the day \u2013 such as public investment in our economy, tax justice, workers\u2019 rights, the housing crisis, the NHS \u2013 he is absolutely right. Corbyn is not responsible for all of Labour\u2019s ills \u2013 far from it. The party is beset by a multitude of structural problems: the crisis of social democratic and centre-left parties across the western world; the post-Brexit division in its electoral coalition between working-class voters in small towns and university-educated voters in big cities; a widening generational divide in voting; and the failure of his predecessors to defend Labour\u2019s record on spending, which continues to undermine the case for investment. These are underlying problems predating Corbyn. Yet the leadership has not only failed to address them, but actually made many of them worse. Of course it\u2019s correct, as Corbyn\u2019s supporters often point out, that Britain\u2019s press is owned by an aggressively rightwing cabal who demonise anyone who even vaguely challenges the status quo. But there needs to be a sophisticated strategy to deal with such entrenched opposition; it has been sorely lacking. And his supporters are right to say that last year\u2019s shambolic coup attempt damaged the party: it was both outrageous and the mark of a farcical absence of political strategy to cripple the opposition at a time of national crisis immediately after the Brexit vote. It undoubtedly has impacted on Labour\u2019s polling. It was delusional to imagine Owen Smith would prove more electable, given his gaffe-ridden commitment to overturning the EU referendum and even refusing to rule out membership of the euro and Schengen. Elements of the parliamentary Labour party undermined Corbyn from the very beginning. But Labour has not once been ahead in the average of polls (which is what counts) since the last general election. Under Miliband, Labour was significantly ahead for long periods through the last parliament, but that was not enough to secure victory.

It was, though, critical to do everything possible to try to make a deeply unexpected victory work and to advance the cause of the left. I believed Corbyn could defy the odds against him by reaching out to those who were neither in poverty or well-off; having a sophisticated media strategy; focusing on issues that mattered to average voters, including older Britons and the self-employed; having a narrative on immigration that didn\u2019t mean indulging xenophobia; redefining patriotism in a way that celebrated great achievements such as the NHS and our ancestors winning rights and freedoms. Above all else, making sure that the leadership had a good first impression \u2013 because a bad first impression is extremely hard to shift.

Head stuck in a tin can. Tricked out of hibernation by increasingly unpredictable winter weather. Modern life, governed by humans, designs a multitude of ingenious ways for a hedgehog to die. It is no wonder that this treasured animal, a suburban garden fixture, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/31/hedgehog-uk-natural-emblem\">which consistently tops favourite-species polls</a> and is the source of many people\u2019s first close encounter with a wild creature, is vanishing from Britain.</p> <p>This disappearance is rapid, and recent. A survey of more than 2,600 people by BBC Gardeners\u2019 World Magazine in February found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/06/hedgehogs-now-a-rare-garden-sight-as-british-populations-continue-to-decline\">51% of gardeners didn\u2019t see a hedgehog at all last year</a>, up from 48% in 2015. Barely one in 10 saw a hedgehog regularly. Scientific studies are unequivocal. Britain\u2019s hedgehog population was calculated to be 1.55 million in 1995. Since the turn of the century <a href=\"http://www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk/pdf/SoBH_2015.pdf\">it has declined by a third in urban areas and up to 75% in the countryside</a>. A survey based on roadkill calculates that hedgehogs are declining by 3% each year. This exceeds <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/categories-and-criteria\">the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list criteria</a>, which identifies species at greatest conservation risk. Why are we obliterating hedgehogs? Will they become extinct? Or can we save them?</p> <p>Ecologist and nature writer Hugh Warwick has a spiky beard, a hedgehog tattoo and a familiar tale of a broken relationship with these beasts. He had hedgehogs in his garden in east Oxford until suddenly, four years ago, they disappeared. \u201cWhat happened four years ago to make the hedgehogs vanish? It\u2019s actually what happened 40 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cWe ended up with an area that was too small for them to survive.\u201d</p> <p>For all the small accidents that can befall a hedgehog, its decline is driven by one big trend, according to Warwick: habitat fragmentation. Female hedgehogs roam an average of 1km every night in search of insects and earthworms; males an average of 2km. To maintain a minimum viable population of 32 individuals in ideal hedgehog habitat (something rather like suburban gardens) there must be 90 hectares of contiguous land \u2013 that\u2019s nearly 1km/sq of good quality, connected land. \u201cThat\u2019s bloody terrifying,\u201d says Warwick. He lives on a 20-hectare housing estate adjoining a seven-hectare park, surrounded by three busy roads and a canalised ditch. Of course, a few hedgehog populations will defy scientific modelling, but once Warwick\u2019s roads became busier and the hedgehogs became trapped within 27 hectares, they were doomed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7965aa40c0b413efa0c48b41be04d1e7bd6148e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7965aa40c0b413efa0c48b41be04d1e7bd6148e9/0_0_3888_2501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Female hedgehogs roam an average of 1km every night in search of insects and worms; males 2km.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Female hedgehogs roam an average of 1km every night in search of insects and worms; males 2km.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hobson/Nature Picture Library/Getty Images/Nature Picture Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ironically, it was a dividing up of the British landscape that was probably the making of the hedgehog, as Warwick reveals in his forthcoming book, <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1099197/linescapes\">Linescapes</a>. This robust, adaptable mammal has been around in a recognisably hedgehoggian form for 15m years. Hedgehogs are \u201cedge\u201d specialists. A Dutch study found they spend 55% of their time within five metres of a hedge. In Britain, the hedgehog was bequeathed bountiful hedges by the 18th and 19th century enclosure movement, which allowed common land to move into private ownership. \u201cThe hedgehog hides beneath the rotten hedge / And makes a great round nest of grass and sedge,\u201d <a href=\"http://poetrynook.com/poem/hedgehog-1\">wrote John Clare</a>, the Northamptonshire farm labourer and poet who railed against the enclosures\u2019 dispossession of the rural poor.</p> <p>\u201cJohn Clare was going mad but the hedgehogs were dancing around, going yippie-fucking-do,\u201d says Warwick. \u201cI imagine that peak hedgehog would have been around the second world war, before the industrialisation of agriculture, and it\u2019s been in decline since then.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists are only beginning to discover how sublethal doses of chemicals and pesticides \u2013 from <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep05634\">glyphosate</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/high-pesticide-levels-on-oilseed-crops-harm-wild-bees-scientists-prove\">neonicotinoids \u2013 </a>affect animal life. \u201cI hear from hedgehog carers how slug pellets are wiping out hedgehogs.

Caroline Gould runs <a href=\"http://www.valewildlife.org.uk/\">Vale Wildlife hospital</a>. Usually, she treats 800 hedgehogs in a year. Last year, she had more than 1,000 admissions. This increase is partly positive: people are much more aware, reports Gould, and if they see a hedgehog in daylight they realise it\u2019s not well and bring it in. She believes that winters swinging between mild and cold wreak havoc with hedgehogs\u2019 traditional November-April hibernation: if they emerge in midwinter, they burn precious fat reserves in the pursuit of food that isn\u2019t there.</p> <p>\u201cThe milder winters also cause a problem with parasites, because parasites thrive better in the warmer, damper autumns that we have now \u2013 particularly things like fluke [a parasitic flatworm],\u201d she says. There\u2019s good news though: while 50-60% of other sick or injured wild animals are returned to the wild, more than 90% of her hedgehogs are rehabilitated. \u201cWe have an excellent success rate with hedgehogs,\u201d says Gould. So hedgehogs make good patients? \u201cI don\u2019t know about good patients. They are expensive patients.\u201d</p> <p>So far, 43,000 people have signed up to be hedgehog champions for <a href=\"http://www.hedgehogstreet.org/\">Hedgehog Street</a>, a project run by the <a href=\"http://www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk/\">British Hedgehog Preservation Society</a> with the <a href=\"https://ptes.org/\">People\u2019s Trust for Endangered Species</a>. People can do many simple things to make their gardens more hedgehog-friendly, says Fay Vass, chief executive of BHPS: check before strimming long grass or starting a bonfire and leave wild patches of dead leaves, long grass or log piles where hedgehogs can make their nests. Best of all, Hedgehog Street encourages everyone to <a href=\"http://www.hedgehogstreet.org/pages/link-your-garden.html\">make a CD-case-sized hole in their garden fence</a> that will help reconnect fragmented urban habitat. \u201cAs their name suggests, hedgehogs tend to stick to the edge of gardens so if there\u2019s a gap in the fence they\u2019ll find it,\u201d says Vass. The BHPS sells <a href=\"http://www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk/shop/product/hedgehog-highway-sign/\">\u201chedgehog highway\u201d plaques</a>, which explain the gap in the fence if people move away. <a href=\"https://www.paragonchg.co.uk/whats-happening/hedgehog-street\">Housing associations</a> and <a href=\"http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/news/2016/09/19/welcome-ipswich-hedgehog-officer\">Wildlife Trusts</a> are joining the hole-making; 3,575 have been marked on Hedgehog Street\u2019s map. BHPS-funded \u201chedgehog officers\u201d are also encouraging councils to leave some grass long; and they supply free stickers to put on council and contractor mowers, reminding them to check for hedgehogs before cutting.</p> <p>In some neighbourhoods, help for hedgehogs is being scaled up. Phil Korbel of <a href=\"http://www.slheatons.org.uk/\">Sustainable Living in the Heatons</a> launched Heatons Hedgehog Highway in Stockport\u2019s suburban fringe. \u201cWe love hedgehogs but we also want to get people talking across their garden fences again. It\u2019s a real magnet for community,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Volunteer Sarah McClelland has made a hole in her fence backing on to an allotment and is helping log hedgehog sightings \u2013 they have collected 30 in the Heatons over the past decade, but fewer in recent years. In April, 23 local \u201chedgehog trackers\u201d will lay out special tubes containing dog food, paper and poster paint, which will reveal hedgehog tracks and show where hedgehog help is needed. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about putting holes in fences, it\u2019s also about giving them little wild areas in gardens and not using slug pellets that poison them,\u201d says McClelland. \u201cThe kids are so excited and desperately want to be hedgehog trackers. It\u2019s really good to see the next generation wanting to take part.\u201d</p> <p>Will there be a next generation of hedgehogs for them to cherish? According to Warwick, the hedgehog is not heading for extinction, but it may become an uncommon animal, and disappear completely from many areas just as the house sparrow vanished from London at the turn of this century. We can identify why specialist species that feed on a particular plant or animal disappear. It\u2019s scarier to lose a generalist animal such as the hedgehog. We don\u2019t know the full story of its disappearance, but we know its vanishing reveals that our anthropogenic environment is inhospitable for many other unheralded animals.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an animal we love and care about deeply. It\u2019s an animal we can get nose-to-nose to, and so we notice its decline,\u201d says Warwick. \u201cThere are species out there we care less for that will be suffering similar fates.

      "bodyText": "Hit by a car. Savaged by a dog. Slashed by a strimmer. Burnt in a bonfire. Tangled in garden netting. Poisoned by slug pellets. Caught in a postman\u2019s discarded rubber bands. Head stuck in a tin can. Tricked out of hibernation by increasingly unpredictable winter weather. Modern life, governed by humans, designs a multitude of ingenious ways for a hedgehog to die. It is no wonder that this treasured animal, a suburban garden fixture, which consistently tops favourite-species polls and is the source of many people\u2019s first close encounter with a wild creature, is vanishing from Britain. This disappearance is rapid, and recent. A survey of more than 2,600 people by BBC Gardeners\u2019 World Magazine in February found that 51% of gardeners didn\u2019t see a hedgehog at all last year, up from 48% in 2015. Barely one in 10 saw a hedgehog regularly. Scientific studies are unequivocal. Britain\u2019s hedgehog population was calculated to be 1.55 million in 1995. Since the turn of the century it has declined by a third in urban areas and up to 75% in the countryside. A survey based on roadkill calculates that hedgehogs are declining by 3% each year. This exceeds the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list criteria, which identifies species at greatest conservation risk. Why are we obliterating hedgehogs? Will they become extinct? Or can we save them? Ecologist and nature writer Hugh Warwick has a spiky beard, a hedgehog tattoo and a familiar tale of a broken relationship with these beasts. He had hedgehogs in his garden in east Oxford until suddenly, four years ago, they disappeared. \u201cWhat happened four years ago to make the hedgehogs vanish? It\u2019s actually what happened 40 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cWe ended up with an area that was too small for them to survive.\u201d For all the small accidents that can befall a hedgehog, its decline is driven by one big trend, according to Warwick: habitat fragmentation. Female hedgehogs roam an average of 1km every night in search of insects and earthworms; males an average of 2km. To maintain a minimum viable population of 32 individuals in ideal hedgehog habitat (something rather like suburban gardens) there must be 90 hectares of contiguous land \u2013 that\u2019s nearly 1km/sq of good quality, connected land. \u201cThat\u2019s bloody terrifying,\u201d says Warwick. He lives on a 20-hectare housing estate adjoining a seven-hectare park, surrounded by three busy roads and a canalised ditch. Of course, a few hedgehog populations will defy scientific modelling, but once Warwick\u2019s roads became busier and the hedgehogs became trapped within 27 hectares, they were doomed. Ironically, it was a dividing up of the British landscape that was probably the making of the hedgehog, as Warwick reveals in his forthcoming book, Linescapes. This robust, adaptable mammal has been around in a recognisably hedgehoggian form for 15m years. Hedgehogs are \u201cedge\u201d specialists. A Dutch study found they spend 55% of their time within five metres of a hedge. In Britain, the hedgehog was bequeathed bountiful hedges by the 18th and 19th century enclosure movement, which allowed common land to move into private ownership. \u201cThe hedgehog hides beneath the rotten hedge / And makes a great round nest of grass and sedge,\u201d wrote John Clare, the Northamptonshire farm labourer and poet who railed against the enclosures\u2019 dispossession of the rural poor. \u201cJohn Clare was going mad but the hedgehogs were dancing around, going yippie-fucking-do,\u201d says Warwick. \u201cI imagine that peak hedgehog would have been around the second world war, before the industrialisation of agriculture, and it\u2019s been in decline since then.\u201d Scientists are only beginning to discover how sublethal doses of chemicals and pesticides \u2013 from glyphosate to neonicotinoids \u2013 affect animal life. \u201cI hear from hedgehog carers how slug pellets are wiping out hedgehogs. We don\u2019t actually have the evidence that slug pellets are having a direct impact,\u201d says Warwick. He would welcome a slug pellet ban, but warns: \u201cIt\u2019s a potential distraction. It\u2019s relatively easy to say, \u2018Let\u2019s get rid of slug pellets to help hedgehogs.\u2019 It\u2019s much harder to say, \u2018Let\u2019s make a more connected landscape to help hedgehogs and other species move through it.\u2019\u201d Mrs Tiggy-Winkle was never troubled by motorways, and roads are an obvious cause of habitat fragmentation in both countryside and town. The biologist Patrick Doncaster radio-tracked eight urban hedgehogs to see how roads affected their foraging and found hedgehogs avoid asphalt, not because of good road sense but because it\u2019s a hard surface that doesn\u2019t contain food. What\u2019s particularly fatal is the significant increase in the number of vehicle journeys being undertaken at night. Still, the hedgehog is declining more slowly in car-filled towns and suburbs than in the countryside. So what\u2019s causing such a precipitous rural decline? Most farmers reply: it\u2019s all those damn badgers. Badger-lovers may find it uncomfortable that the scientific evidence in part supports this assertion. A 2014 survey found active badger setts in England had doubled since the late 1980s, and the number of badger social groups in England is growing by 2.6% each year (badger populations are stable in Wales and rising more slowly in Scotland). Legal protection, milder winters and farming patterns \u2013 notably increases in maize, which badgers adore \u2013 are helping the badger thrive. Is there a correlation between more badgers and fewer hedgehogs? Doncaster introduced 30 radio-tagged hedgehogs to a badger-filled wood in Oxfordshire and found seven of them were eaten by badgers. Badgers and hedgehogs enjoy what scientists call \u201can asymmetric intra-guild predatory relationship\u201d: they eat the same food \u2013 mostly earthworms, grubs and beetles \u2013 but if that food becomes scarce, or if the badger population reaches a certain density, then the bigger beast preys on the smaller. A study of hedgehog-friendly grassland habitat within a scientific badger cull zone found that counts of hedgehogs more than doubled over five years from 1998. The authors concluded: \u201cPrevious studies indicate that badger predation is one of the main causes of hedgehog mortality, and that badger density correlates negatively with hedgehog abundance.\u201d That may be so, argues Warwick, but humans, not badgers, are the principal architects of hedgehogs\u2019 decline.

Swifts These amazing migratory birds scream as they dash through the sky and breed in British towns every summer. They can go at least 10 months without touching solid ground but have still declined by 33% over the last decade. Modern building regulations have blocked up their nests in the eaves but a loss of insect food is also driving their disappearance. Foxes There is some evidence urban fox numbers are rising, particularly in the north, but England\u2019s fox population has fallen by 43% between 1995 and 2015, including a sharp drop since 2010. A decline in rabbit numbers, because of disease and falling earthworm populations, are the main factors, but there is anecdotal evidence that more have been shot since the hunting ban. Bees A study of 62 species of wild bees that feed on flowers of oilseed rape found declines of up to 30% over 17 years, with a 10% reduction in distribution attributed to recently banned neonicotinoid pesticides. On average, nearly 20% of Britain\u2019s honeybee colonies have been lost each winter since surveying began nine years ago.",

Joel Whitebook\u2019s illuminating intellectual biography is part of this fresh and buoyant wave of\u00a0thinking.</p> <p>It marks a welcome change from the bile of the Freud wars, that wholesale attack during the last two decades of the 20th century on Freud\u2019s reputation and work (or what might lurk under his capacious mantle). In the US, the virulence of the assault was undoubtedly linked to the postwar centrality of psychoanalysis in both popular and medical culture, where it formed part of psychiatric training until the rollout of drug therapies from the 70s on.</p> <p>Herzog shows with telling detailhow the variety of psychoanalysis that was developed in the US after the second world war had little in common with Freud\u2019s initial project. A wholesale flight from sexuality and an insistence on conservative conformity within the patriotic family dominated many analysts\u2019 repertoire. The sign of \u201ccure\u201d for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_psychology\" title=\"\">ego psychologists</a> became an individual\u2019s ability to control her impulses and adapt to reality. What was understood by \u201creality\u201d was delimited by the norms of the 50s. The analyst\u2019s task was to work through internal conflicts with the patient, never bringing in shaping social or political conditions. Even analysts for whom Freud\u2019s libidinal emphases were in play sent women back to sterile marriages and worse. Convention ruled, undeterred by the famous emigres from the Frankfurt School who married Freud to social critique and had started publishing in the US.</p> <p>Herzog brings fascinating documents to bear to show how US psychoanalysts formed alliances with Christian clergy who themselves wanted treatment. In 1952, Pope Pius XII even granted his imprimatur to analysis \u2013 as long as it didn\u2019t arouse too many sexual appetites. It was against this cold war analytic ethos that the women\u2019s movement reacted so vociferously, often blaming Freud for a practice that wasn\u2019t his.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"92da9b0ca047237a609a4c56b3576bce87f364a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92da9b0ca047237a609a4c56b3576bce87f364a8/0_0_2544_1842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freud in his study in 1937, two years before he died.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freud in his study in 1937, two years before he died.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Homosexuality was a highly fraught arena, judged by the analysts to be a perverse condition that could be successfully treated.

During the 50s, when postwar reparations were being sought from Germany, it was disputed that the camps could have long-term psychic as well as physical damage on individual survivors, particularly since psychic damage seemed only to manifest itself after the event. A large dose of antisemitism was at work in these deliberations. Only with the Vietnam war (and the work of NGOs with torture survivors) did PTSD become a recognised mental disorder.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whitebook argues that Freud was never able fully to explore the unruly, pre-linguistic, pre-Oedipal maternal sphere</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whitebook\u2019s <em>Freud</em> is an elegant foray into the man and his mind by a philosopher who is also a psychoanalyst. Freud was notoriously suspicious of biographers (as Adam Phillips\u2019 recent anti-biography of the young Freud stressed). Perhaps he intuited that, once he had given us something of a Proustian autobiography in <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em>, the very readings his own work prompted would be turned back on himself. Whitebook is both questioning and respectful. He is also shaped by present intellectual currents, so a discomfort with enlightenment universals and an alertness to gender underpin this book far more than they did, say, Peter Gay\u2019s classic <em>Freud: A Life for Our Time</em> or Ernest Jones\u2019s first enthusiastic portrayal of the Freud who was his friend and mentor.</p> <p>Whitebook persuasively positions Freud as a thinker of the dark enlightenment, \u201ca deeper, conflicted, disconsolate, and even tragic yet still emancipatory tradition within the broader movement of the enlightenment\u201d. Freud understood the forces of the counter-enlightenment, the pull of the\u00a0irrational, the sway of belief, and integrated all this into his vision. Whitebook\u2019s Freud broke with his own Jewish tradition to forge an identity as a secular and sceptical scientist, but was alert to the shaping distortions of the passions he so skilfully reinterpreted. He offers new insight into Freud\u2019s move away from philosophy to science and medicine, and gives a gripping and even-handed rendition of Freud\u2019s homoerotic yet thoroughly intellectual friendships with the zany but charismatic Berlin doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1985/jun/23/biography.sigmundfreud\" title=\"\">Wilhelm Fliess</a> and later with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/may/30/carl-jung-ego-self\" title=\"\">Carl Gustav Jung</a>.</p> <p>My only reservation with Whitebook\u2019s account is his attributing a modish traumatic significance to Freud\u2019s early family life. He speculates that Freud was traumatised by the oddness of his relations with his mother, Amalia. He was her first, idealised son, but in the aftermath of her next son\u2019s early death, she purportedly developed depression, leaving little Ziggy to the whims of his Catholic nanny. Amalia was a generation younger than Freud\u2019s father, which also meant that one of Freud\u2019s nephews was a little older than him. As a result of this family constellation, Whitebook argues, Freud was never able fully to explore and theorise the unruly, pre-linguistic, pre-Oedipal maternal sphere. Mothers are far less central to Freud\u2019s thinking than fathers. But as a child of the second half of the 19th century, Freud\u2019s early experience was historically hardly uncommon. The powers of patriarchy may have had as much to do with the \u201cMissing Mother\u201d in his work (a figure also important in much Victorian literature) as his own intra-psychic state.

      "body": "<p>The writer who maintains that \u201cprogress\u201d is a sham can always be fairly sure of a hearing. After all, whatever the wonders of its gadgetry, no advanced society has ever quite been able to convince a substantial part of its populace that present and future have the edge on an endlessly mythologised past. Much less certain is the political context of this ardent backward glance. GK Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc\u2019s interwar era \u201cDistributist League\u201d, for\u00a0example, was the\u00a0last genuinely reactionary political movement in the\u00a0UK (with the possible exception of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip\" title=\"\">Ukip</a>). It\u00a0brought together a bizarre coalition of\u00a0traditional Conservatives, keen on\u00a0individualism and self help, and left-leaning radicals eager to defend small property holders against the\u00a0oligarchs.</p> <p>In the end Chesterton\u2019s mock-medievalism \u2013 his idea that we should all be much better off with a pig than a\u00a0radiogram \u2013 defies most of the classifications of contemporary politics. In his brief introduction to <em>The World\u2011Ending Fire</em>, Paul Kingsnorth makes the\u00a0same point about Wendell Berry\u2019s half-century campaign on behalf of old-style US agrarianism, the sanctity of the dairy farm and the sharecropper\u2019s 40-acre plot. From one\u00a0angle, Berry (born 1934), with his sonorous, preacher\u2019s style and his horror of colonising concrete, looks like an arch-conservative, and yet money, markets and corporatism are\u00a0forever looming into his sights.

      "bodyText": "The writer who maintains that \u201cprogress\u201d is a sham can always be fairly sure of a hearing. After all, whatever the wonders of its gadgetry, no advanced society has ever quite been able to convince a substantial part of its populace that present and future have the edge on an endlessly mythologised past. Much less certain is the political context of this ardent backward glance. GK Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc\u2019s interwar era \u201cDistributist League\u201d, for&nbsp;example, was the&nbsp;last genuinely reactionary political movement in the&nbsp;UK (with the possible exception of&nbsp;Ukip). It&nbsp;brought together a bizarre coalition of&nbsp;traditional Conservatives, keen on&nbsp;individualism and self help, and left-leaning radicals eager to defend small property holders against the&nbsp;oligarchs. In the end Chesterton\u2019s mock-medievalism \u2013 his idea that we should all be much better off with a pig than a&nbsp;radiogram \u2013 defies most of the classifications of contemporary politics. In his brief introduction to The World\u2011Ending Fire, Paul Kingsnorth makes the&nbsp;same point about Wendell Berry\u2019s half-century campaign on behalf of old-style US agrarianism, the sanctity of the dairy farm and the sharecropper\u2019s 40-acre plot. From one&nbsp;angle, Berry (born 1934), with his sonorous, preacher\u2019s style and his horror of colonising concrete, looks like an arch-conservative, and yet money, markets and corporatism are&nbsp;forever looming into his sights. From another, he looks like a classic eco-lefty pitting himself against the big battalions of agri-business, and yet his assaults on individualism, rootlessness and urban snobbery will be enough to&nbsp;leave most leftwingers feeling deeply uncomfortable. All this is further complicated by the particular locales (or rather, locale, as the author has stayed tethered to his native Kentucky for the last 50 years) through which Berry so observantly passes. He is not, for instance, a great-outdoors merchant in the manner of Edward Hoagland and Annie Proulx; he is more interested in soil quality than fauna.

About the closest equivalent to&nbsp;his tough-minded, small-scale environmentalism on this side of the Atlantic would be the George Ewart Evans of Ask the Fellows Who Cut the Hay or the John Stewart Collis of The Worm Forgives the Plough, and even that is not very close. Berry\u2019s essays roam widely over such&nbsp;topics as \u201cWriter and Region\u201d (an A-grade discussion of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn), \u201cThe Work of Local Culture\u201d and his high-minded disinclination to swap his ancient typewriter for a computer (complete with several shocked technophile responses). But the majority of them return, out of a kind of disgust, to the idea of betrayal, and the way in which the US farming industry has abandoned its responsibility to the terrain it has been cultivating for the last century and a half. The startling aspect of this charge sheet is its proxy villain, which is neither the cereal companies nor the burger chains but the American dream.

Another option included focusing the EU on the single market, allowing common foreign and migration policy to wither, but Juncker said he was opposed to this idea, which he believes would reduce the commission to being an administrator. \u201cEurope has to be about more than market, goods and money,\u201d he added.<br /></p> <p>Although the document looked ahead to the next decade, there was scant reference to new EU members, although enlargement was not ruled out.

The EU already consists of multiple overlapping groupings: not all countries are members of the euro or border-free travel area. Small groups of countries can join forces in defence, or decide to pass a new law as a result of flexibility in the EU rulebook. Juncker, who is halfway through his five-year term, presented five options on the EU\u2019s future to the European parliament in Brussels. He hopes EU leaders, who are deeply divided on migration and the eurozone, can sign up to a plan before European elections in 2019. But he made clear he would not lead the debate after 2019, restating his intention not to seek a second term as commission president. The first option was to continue muddling through, with poisonous fights over how to deal with the migration crisis likely to continue and \u201cincremental progress\u201d on fixing the single currency. At the other end of the scale was a plan for a federal EU, where it would have one seat at the G7 or G20 and create a defence union. Another option included focusing the EU on the single market, allowing common foreign and migration policy to wither, but Juncker said he was opposed to this idea, which he believes would reduce the commission to being an administrator. \u201cEurope has to be about more than market, goods and money,\u201d he added. Although the document looked ahead to the next decade, there was scant reference to new EU members, although enlargement was not ruled out. Neither did the paper deal directly with the EU\u2019s conundrum over Poland, despite references to European values and the rule of law. Poland\u2019s rightwing ruling party is locked in conflict with Brussels over changes to its constitutional court that the commission says pose \u201ca persistent problem with the rule of law\u201d. Isabella L\u00f6vin, Sweden\u2019s deputy prime minister, backed Juncker\u2019s analysis that EU members were too quick to blame Brussels for their problems. \u201cMany EU member states have used the EU as a scapegoat for everything that goes wrong in their country and taking credit for everything that goes right,\u201d she told the Guardian shortly before Juncker\u2019s speech. \u201cThe EU has brought so much prosperity to so many countries and then national governments take all the credit for that.\u201d She also made clear Sweden was not interested in a federal EU. The speech received a mixed reaction from MEPs. While Eurosceptic MEPs lobbed verbal brickbats at Juncker, others were disappointed not to hear a more assertive defence of European integration. Guy Verhofstadt, the Liberal leader and staunch federalist, lamented that the EU remained a \u201cloose confederation of member states\u201d in which many decisions can be blocked by a single country. Verhofstadt, the parliament\u2019s Brexit pointman, also took a moment to take a swipe at Boris Johnson. He said the British foreign secretary and Churchill biographer had \u201cforgotten\u201d that Britain\u2019s wartime leader was \u201cthe father of European integration\u201d. Churchill called for a United States of Europe in 1946 but said Britain would be one of the \u201cfriends and sponsors\u201d of the new Europe, an ambiguity about the UK\u2019s place in Europe that has haunted his successors.",

The last time we saw him in Prometheus, David had lost his head both figuratively and literally, seeding Logan Marshall-Green\u2019s unfortunate Charlie with a single drop of mysterious black goo in a dastardly experiment that eventually led to the birth of the trilobite and deacon aliens, before being decapitated by an Engineer. Is that a hooded David holding a gun in a brief shot from the trailer? If so, somebody must has have helped the mischievous android put his head back on. We know Shaw will also be seen in the new movie, potentially in a flashback, so perhaps she came to the aid of her erstwhile travelling companion.

In Covenant, the full range of nightmarish nasties is on display in the new trailer, from egg to facehugger, the hint of a chestburster (or backburster?) and at least two full-grown monstrosities. The first is a horrifying black-carapaced quadrupedal beast trying to get to Danny McBride\u2019s Tennessee, the other a paler creature that recalls Alien 3\u2019s canine-spawned \u201crunner\u201d xenomorph but boasts colouring reminiscent of the Engineer-born deacon alien in Prometheus. Might the two monsters be the same creature in different stages of development? Or, as with previous films in the space saga, might they appear differently because they were spawned by different hosts? These new xenomorphs appear a lot more mobile and agile than their grim cousins from the early movies, and are certainly as ugly, though they seem to have lost something of the phallic threat of the HR Giger-designed originals. </p> <h2>Stop me if you think you\u2019ve seen this one before</h2> <p>Prometheus came in for criticism for trying to widen the Alien mythos via the introduction of a portentous backstory with pseudo-religious overtones.

Alien: Covenant meant to return the saga to its slasher-flick-in-space roots, and the trailer certainly bodes well for those hoping to fill their boots with body horror futurism. But we\u2019ve seen bumbling space morons wandering blindly into xenomorph hell dozens of times in these films, and if the new movie is to succeed it will have to offer a fresh take on the well-worn template.

      "bodyText": "The \u201cbig boy\u201d is back. Five years after the sporadically thrilling yet utterly obtuse Prometheus left us with more questions than answers about the Alien universe and the mysterious, godlike Engineers, the latest trailer for Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien: Covenant restores the iconic xenomorph to centre stage \u2013 or at least, its 21st-century cousin. But can the veteran film-maker\u2019s latest venture into the drool-dripping maw of extra-terrestrial purgatory satisfyingly pick up all those lost threads from its frustrating predecessor? What happened to Noomi Rapace\u2019s Elizabeth Shaw and Michael Fassbender\u2019s David the android, last seen setting off for the Engineers\u2019 home world in a borrowed ship? Will the new crew prove any more canny than their forebears at sidestepping completely avoidable demises? And do our space daddies really want to destroy mankind because we killed Jesus?
